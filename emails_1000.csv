I spoke with Louis Dicarlo this morning and he referred me to you as the contact for estate confirmations.  Is it possible to get copies of the confirmations for the Enervest deal numbers listed below?  George needs them for a meeting with the estate lawyers.

Please let me know.

Thank you:

I wrote the ""New Business Idea"" email in HTML and apparently the formatting
was lost when it was sent to most of you...making it impossible to read.  I
have saved it in a PDF format along with an article I found funny
(referenced in the email message).

After you read the message, you may think that I've lost my mind.  I am
accepting investors, though.

		 Subject: The Answer Is:  To CLEC!

Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Sue

Thank you all for your willingness to serve on our Habitat project.  All of you were chosen for some leadership position because of your skill and experience.   

The biggest challenge with this project is the number of people who want to participate.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to complete the house, probably ahead of schedule, with this much manpower, so long as Habitat has the supplies on hand.  From our standpoint, the purpose of the project is as much ministry and fellowship as the end product, which is why we didn't turn any volunteers away.   

I encourage each of you to participate on as many Saturdays as possible.  We will need some continuity in leadership since so many volunteers will be participating for only one or two Saturdays, and that may be a month apart.  At the same time, there are enough leaders that you shouldn't feel guilty if you have other obligations.  When you are available, you will be instrumental in keeping people organized, safe and productive. 

Thank you again.

   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside
   information"" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below.  This language is 
very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates 
issue.  I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.  Please let me 
know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  It is important that we 
work something out with Phillips today.

By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their 
right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language 
(i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in 
exchange for us making this compromise.  She feels that it would be 
inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give 
Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).

any changes that you feel needs to be made, please try to keep the changes as

Aug should be 1,089,109, Sep is good and Oct should be 121,013. Apr was 
786,579
while May, Jun & Jul were same as Aug. Your total for 7/31 is OK. Remember
these are theoretical numbers by which you bill CES/NPC. They also don't 
divide

Subject: Re: estimating tail of distribution and additional risk measures  

Naveen,
the ""analytical VAR"" approach is working for Equity portfolio. 
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and 
calculate ""Expected Tail Loss"".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses 
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% 
calculated with 
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

 1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity 
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to 
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for 
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5% 
different from the correct number). 
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio 
until we have proper methods implemented.

Subject: Re: ""analytical"" var implementation in RisktRAC  

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
""analytical"" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Tanya

now that we are officially behind a chinese wall can this process be

The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General 
Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of them 
then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations.  
Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at 
once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?

Sherry, 

This stuff looks perfect. I think I like the 385-B the best. I don't think I want the hutch though. So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company. 

Thanx for all the help!

Chris

All,

Further to my earlier email, I thought the following information would be of use to you:

1)  Jeff Skilling and Tim Underdown held a short press briefing at 12.30pm this afternoon -- a transcript from the briefing has been posted on the European website ( www.europe.enron.com ) and a quick, simple note is being circulated to staff in Europe, Japan and Australia advising them how to access the transcript.

2) Paul Lund with Standard & Poors' Infrastructure Financing Ratings division contacted us to advise S&P plan to issue a statement on Teesside Power Finance Limited this afternoon regarding the situation at Teesside power station.  We have run the statement by Richard Lewis and Legal and are requesting two minor changes be made before it is released, but in principle the statement is accurate and we have no issues with it.  See attached amended document: 
 
3) In terms of enquiries that are coming in to us on the commercial viability of the plant, we have agreed with Richard Lewis that we will not enter into any discussions of this nature.  Our focus as a company is on supporting the friends and family of the victims and to cooperate with the investigation into the cause of the explosion -- not to comment on the commercial impact of the plant being off line.

4) Finally, we expect to be in a position to release the names of the four employees tomorrow once they have been formally identified.  We are hoping that the Health and Safety Executive will be able to release, at a minimum, its preliminary findings by early next week at the latest.  More information to follow on both issues.

Just an FYI, if you want to alter procedures in production already, you can use the command Alter Procedure, instead of Create Procedure.  Everything else would be as you have it in your scripts.  All it does is change the code of the procedure without touching dependencies or permissions.  I'll change that in these so that you don't have to.

Thanks, :)

Hello, everyone.  I'm hoping you know of someone who would be a good fit fo=
r an interesting opportunity in Market Risk Management in RAC:

We're looking for a director level accountant or risk management operations=
 person who can join the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) group within Marke=
t Risk Management to work on the Asset/Liability piece of Enterprise Risk M=
anagement project as we team up with Vince Kaminski's Research group on thi=
s challenging new initiative.

The ideal candidate would have Enron experience and be a good project manag=
er, accustomed to working in self-directed situations, able to work with an=
d gain the team support of  mid and upper level management in  research, ac=
counting, risk management operations, finance, treasury, RAC, the business =
units, etc..  They would need to be able to articulate for top support and =
commercial management any project issues and implementation challenges, and=
 would be working with risk mgmt operations and the business units on the i=
mplementation efforts and process design.  Someone able to take full respon=
sibility for this long term project from its infancy through completion, de=
signing a plan of attack, and then leading the implementation effort.  This=
 person might also act as a consultant for SRM's other initiatives that imp=
act accounting.  Ideally, of course, this person would understand risk mana=
gement (risk books, trading operations, etc.), but someone who understands =
the different types of risks inherent in our strategic assets and accrual a=
ccounting contracts might also be a good fit if they're self-motivated and =
willing to dig in and learn the risk management business.

I think it's a great opportunity for someone to broaden their resume and ga=
in market risk management expertise.  We've met with top risk management co=
nsultants, and this is a cutting edge initiative that will put us head and =
shoulders above our peers.

If you want to forward this to potential candidates, below are some links t=
o websites that may provide some overview information on asset-liability / =
EW risk management (I haven't reviewed the sites myself yet).  Also, Vince'=
s outline on Enterprise Risk Management from early last year is attached be=
low. =20

Please call me if you know of someone who might be interested.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

PJM West is scheduled to go into operation January 1, 2002 (there is some talk that the IT vendors are somewhat behind schedule do to the priority of getting NYC back in operation and that this may delay the startup - I will keep you posted).  On Day 1 of operation, PJM West will be the Allegheny control area only.  Work is progressing on Duquesne and the earliest date I have heard for integration of Duquesne into PJM West is sometime in the 1st quarter of 2002.  PJM West and PJM proper will be integrated such that there is one energy market (day-ahead and real-time) across the entire region, based on LMP, and no pancaking of transmission rates (pay the rate of the transmission system at point of withdrawal just as is done in PJM today).  However, there will be two different capacity markets - ICAP in PJM and ACAP in PJM West - to reflect the difference in reliability standards of the two NERC regions.

PJM has recently announced PJM West market trials for the Day-Ahead market on Nov 21 and Nov 28.  Real-time energy market trials are scheduled to be conducted starting on Nov 26 and continuing through Dec 31.  For additional information regarding the market trial see the enclosed notice from PJM.

Tom, could you do a paragraph up that describes PJM West (i.e operation, LMP, players, key dates, tx instruments etc) for Robert Benson and copy it to Kevin (they only want a paragraph at most).  They are especially interested in whether PJM West intend to price aggregate nodes to create hubs on start date.  Theres no point in me acting as intermediary....

Please start the following task in the morning:

Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from, add the following counterparty's MTM by desk:
Constellation 
Energy Authority
Sempra Energy Trading
Public Service of Colorado

I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books.  Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels.

Thanks,

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff"

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team."

Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Rosie

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a ""cop out"".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca

Dear Dan.

Due to the time schedule and uncertainty regarding the eta Fujairah,
we desided to not nominating bunkers for topping up this time.
The vessel's rob on arrival Qalhat will be abt F.O. 3800mt and G.O.
155 mt.

I agree with Rick.  I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input 
will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of 
required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you 
know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how 
is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do 
about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to 
make these assessments.

I have reviewed the most recent IM and don't have any significant comments, 
but my review did highlight the need to have a set or sets of 
eyes(internally) who understand the regulatory overlay of the Southern Cone 
better and who are also in a better position  ( physically and with language 
skills ) to assess the  nature of the regulatory approvals needed and to 
effectively pull on a set of local resources when this project begins to take 
shape- With all of that in mind, I would recommend we , at the very least, 
bring Jose into the loop. I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I 
can, but we need help immediately on the regulatory front - the last thing I 
would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the 
governmental approval stage-  being proactive now by bringing Jose over the 
wall would be my strong recommendation.Please advise.

See the email below from Andy Ott.  Andy is working on a new FTR product and would like industry feedback.  We could either provide our responses in writing or we could arrange a conference call with Andy so that you all could ask additional questions and have more of a dialogue.  If would like to respond in writing, Tom Hoatson and I will work with you to get everyone's input and prepare our response.

Please let us know.

Thanks

Sarah,    
I am working with several groups to design a better Financial Transmission
Rights product for PJM (and other RTO regions) and I would like to get feedback
from Enron in several areas ...

1.  Under the current PJM FTR Auction system a customer can request FTRs between
any two points (including Hubs, Zones, etc.). From your perspective, would there
be any benefit to also offering a Financial 'flowgate-type' product in this
auction ?  The product would be like a grouping of FTR paths similar in concept
to the way we group buses to form the Western Hub....  sort of like a Hub for
FTRs design to attempt to get my trading volume (liquidity) in the transmission
rights products. 

2.  As we look forward to a NE RTO, what is the best set of FTR Auction periods
that we should offer ?  ( i.e. Yearly, Monthly, Multi-year, weekly)

3.  How important would a uni-directional FTR product (no down side risk) be to
you.  

4.  Describe what characteristics you are looking for in a Transmission
Congestion hedging product. 

5.  If you had a choice between the products described in items 1 and 3, which
would you want first ?   "

One more item

1 e. Suspend or relax the RACT (""Reasonably Available Control Technology"") 
adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs.  
Example:  When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria, we 
realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern 
County.  We developed an agreement with GE, because the projects all had GE 
turbines and GE serviced them, to approach the owners of the projects and 
offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an 
attractive business deal.  The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX (""DLN"") 
which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ~25ppm to <9ppm.  To our 
surprise, since these reductions are ""RACT"", per present Clean Air Rules we 
can get credit only for reductions below 9 ppm.  Maybe that is intellectually 
OK, but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to 
reduce emissions to RACT standards.  So, they keep polluting at 25 ppm...   
We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking, 
mentioned in item 1.d.  We are working with the largest single source of 
pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs, which if successful, 
will reduce emissions by >1000 tons per year, enough for at least a 1000 MW 
plant.  However, there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs.  We 
are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and 
""RACT adjust"" any emissions reductions we may get.  I will tell you if that 
happens, the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not 
work and they will continue to pollute......  You can mention in public the 
Kern County example, but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant 
initiative.

		 Subject: Re: Urgent - Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing, need info

I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart.  But a few comments 
to Steve's point on siting new power plants.  I ASSUME ""SENATE ENERGY 
COMMITTEE"" IS THE FEDERAL SENATE, NOT THE STATE SENATE.  I HAVE GEARED MY 
SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO.:

THE PREAMBLE: The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing 
serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make 
the $billions in investments required for new power plants.  The desparate 
search for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make the 
investment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations of 
what happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing a 
good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the 
""market"" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power 
plants in the state's history.  To the point, the debt lenders are getting 
nervous; the equity providors are getting nervous.  (Duke:  ""I would have 
less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil..."")  If the final result 
of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and 
the buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will have 
traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to 
the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases.  In my 
opinion, there is no way that the governor's present political initiatives 
will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the 
demand.  He may be covering the near term price/supply issues with his CDWR 
initiative (I note that it is winter time and power demand is down, 
notwithstanding stage 3 alerts - wait until summer peak demands...), but 
destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in 
this market.  If the politicians think the ""state"" can do the development, I 
don't think so.  Think about it:  there just is not anyone in the IOUs or 
CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary 
to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER.    The public entities 
do not even have the staffs to do the required work, much less the political 
environment to get anything done, given the continued thirst for ""doing 
things right"" vs ""doing the right thing.""  Maybe we will get back to long 
term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants.  I 
point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the ""State"" and 
entered into 15 - 20 YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly 10,000 MW 
of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY.  (Per SCE, since the PX began in 4/98, 
only during August and December of last year were they in the money.  We 
checked it out - they are right.  That is astounding.  And we want to go back 
to that??)  Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs, 
especially since we are developing several sites, and can make money doing 
that.  But if we want to be statesmen about this, we need must get a market 
paradigm back.

THE SUGGESTIONS :

1. Federal Environmental issues:  There are 4 agencies in CA that get 
involved in air issues:  US EPA, CEC, CARB, and the local AQMD.  Lot's of 
rhetoric that each is just doing its own job, but the de facto result of that 
many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the 
requirements end up much tougher than they need to be.  Letting the state 
deal with the last 3, and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will 
be testifying, seems like the US EPA (probably through a change in law at the 
Federal level) could do the following:

 a. Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts 
and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions.  To our utter 
amazement, every little district that we have gone into to develop power 
plants have completely different rules and have required a completely 
different approach re ERCs- SF Bay Area, South Coast, San Joaquin County, 
Kern County, Placer, etc.  ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in 
moving forward on the development of over 2000 MW of new plants we have on 
the books.  I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX.  SOX ERCs 
produced in Ohio can  be used in a new plant in Indiana.  This is not 
technically crisp, but was a rational, political decision as part of the 
Clean Air Act.  We need that same rationalization now in California.  
Granted, CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of 
AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries, but if we can get the state to 
the table to change this, the EPA will be involved.  Leadership by all is 
necessary.  When 2.5 ppm new plants are being held up, the 100 ppm plants 
will continue to be used to produce the power.  Do the math and tell me if 
the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result.  Do it 
again realizing that many of these 2.5 ppm plants will never be developed, 
given the difficulty. 

 b. Consider impact fees:  the concept of ""pay to pollute.""  In LA, there are 
car pool requirements to reduce pollution.  If a company cannot or will not 
carpool sufficiently, they can pay a fine that the district applies (I think) 
to general programs, like electric water heaters vs gas, electric lawn mowers 
vs gasoline, mass transit, etc.  Implement a similar program for power 
plants. Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a 
program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits (FYI:  
+$20 million for Pastoria) which the district uses to develop credits from 
existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up  (see list 4 lines above, 
and others.)  Necessity:  power plant proceeds while credits are being 
develop.  If it takes 10 years to develop the credits, consider issues and 
value of fact that the 2.5 ppm plant will eventually replace the 100 ppm 
plants.

 c. Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague 
representations, inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements.  
Example:  Several years ago, Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX 
reduction in a 25 MW unit in LA.  Good thing to do, but based primarily on 
the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goalline's president, 
we got ratcheted down on our 500 MW plant in Pittsburg to 2.5 ppm.  SCAQMD 
calls to SCR vendors indicated ""we can do that"".  EPA jumped on board.  
Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different 
than ""we can do that"" from an equipment supplier.  Now, EPA and others are 
wanting 2 ppm, again based on vague data.  Sam even advises requests to 
consider ~1 ppm.   (I point out that there are ZERO frame 7Fa units in 
operation at these levels in California.)  GE has told us ""absolutely not"" to 
a 2ppm guarantee.  However, I believe that requirements will in fact be 
reduced again by EPA, just because they can.  Again, do the math on delaying 
or stopping the development of, say, a 2.5 ppm plant (because EPA wants 2 
ppm) in favor of the continued operation of a 100 ppm plant.  Hugely more 
resultant pollution.

 d. Be open minded and proactive with developers' novel methods of creating 
new sources of ERCs.  PG&E had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay 
Mesa 500 MW power plant in San Diego, ending up putting new engines in 4 
harbor boats and +100 garbage trucks.  Enron has several similarly dificult 
initiatives underway (Steve cannot tell anyone this, FYI only:  we are 
looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay, replacing engines in 
""yard"" locomotives in Sacramento and LA, replacing agricultural pumping 
engines in the Central Valley, putting SCR technology in cement plants all 
over CA.)  We could take years to get these programs approved as did PG&E, or 
we can take several months, with EPAs (and others) leadership.

2. Federal Siting Issues:  California is at least attempting through 
legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants.  Unfortunately, the 
Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their 
review on the speeded up schedules.  For example, a request of the Fish and 
Wildlife Department for a review/permit gets put on the priority pile, first 
come first serve:  shopping centers, housing developments, power plants, 
power lines, etc.  I understand that our Pastoria project had 65 F&W 
applications ahead of it when we applied.  And, there was no limitation on 
how long they could take to get the review done.  I understand that one power 
project has waited 2 years for its review.  The only way we got our permit 
was Sam Wehn begged F&W to figure a way to get it done ahead of the 65 other 
applications.  Fortunately, F&W figured that we could reapply under an EPA 
rule in this specific case, which did have a timeline limitation.  We should 
not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted.  Suggestion:  require the 
federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to 
speed up their review/permitting times to be consistent with the state 
initiatives to speed things up.  

3. Market Issues:  I will not go into this in detail, as Steve is more able 
than I to vocalize these issues.  However, from a power plant development 
point of view, if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power 
plants, and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment 
required, we must get back to a market structure.  As I am sure Steve 
remembers, one of the big issues we all dealt with in ""deregulation"" was 
stranded cost.  We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to 
make the investments.  Steve knows all the issues:  stability, liquidity, 
credit worthy counterparties, lots of counterparties, etc.

Michelle,

I met with Cheryl Slone & Johnny Ross yesterday regarding our current In-effective termination process when it comes to American Express balances for terminated employees.  

After sitting down with both, I made my recommendations and I got their feedback as well.  It seems that the following outlined recommendations is what we both agreed upon and would like to implement immediately.  However, I would like your blessing on this before I actually send out the communication to my team and the EWS HR Community.  

I have attached our current termination process flow.  

Recommendations from yesterday's mtg. 

1) Begin requesting an American Express balance at the same time we send the request for the stock option summary.

2) Provide balance sheet in termination folder for generalist to conduct the Exit interview.

3) Reiterate to employee their signed corporate card agreement, Number 9, which you can see in the attachment below. 
	I understand that UPON MY TERMINATION I will have to pay any outstanding balance owed on the Corporate Card
	PRIOR to receiving my final check.  I hereby authorize Enron to withhold from my check or checks, any and all amounts
	outstanding.

4) Since the employe will be processing a final expense report and will be receiving a check from the expense report group, an automatic deduction from their final check for their balance should not be a great impact for them.

5) This will reduce the time and energy that HR Reps spend tracking ex-employees after the fact and confirming that they have paid Amex, after they have received their final Expense Report.

6) My team has the access to include Amex balance withholding as part of our SAP Termination action before payroll finalizes.

7) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!  This reduces the liability that Enron has had to incur with Amex and will save our Company a tremendous amount of money.   

8) For those balances that are more than the actual final check amount, the HR Svc Connection will work with the generalist on a case by case basis.

Again, if you could please give me your approval or feedback asap, that would be great.

Thank you ma'am.

For the two amended counterparties listed, I have amended-no change, because 
neither was approved for physical power or financial trading, and I do not 
want that to change.  I don't care about Credit opening them up or shutting 
them down for physical gas.

Yes, they are getting a nice building, but will anyone still be here when they get it?

Dave just dropped by. He's around until 2:30 today, and back tomorrow.

Are you coming over?

Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we 
should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are 
physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have 
access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade 
UK derivatives should have access.

Justin,

I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict 
access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up 
the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit).

Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict 
access.

Thanks,

TO:
ALL NYMEX/COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL MEMBER FIRMS
ALL CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF

RE:
POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS 
[NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]


As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
October 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to September 18, 2000.

Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are below.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920 or Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919.


NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date.  The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of 
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the 
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

Happy anniversary!  I hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call 
you to wish you that over the phone on my way home.  

Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting 
Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this 
week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  

We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is 
having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has 
some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  

I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we 
discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back 
home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a 
total for gifts for both girls.  

Love, Sally

Dear Sally,  Hope you are about finish up at the office and are headed home
soon.  I am eager to hear how things are going at your house.  Do you have
most everything back in place or were you too busy getting Amanda ready.

Is Amanda having a good time again this year?  I have written her several
times.

I would like very much to know what I owe you for Meagan and Amanda's
birthday presents, so If you have time this week-end perhaps you can give me
a call.  Give that Tyler a big hug for us.

Love,

Mom

	Just talked with Mark McConnell and Lonestar rejected (AGAIN) our lastest proposal
	on the new OBA language.  We are starting to get to a point where
	our customers are being impacted by imbalance issues.  Therefore we
	need to put closure to this issue.

	Mark and Bill Rapp are working on the Volumetric OBA and will try to
	turn this around as quickly as possible.  Mark and I agreed we would continue
	monitoring this point on a daily basis as we have done in the past.
	
	I appreciate everyone's help in trying to resolve this issue.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Attached are the results of our East Power review.  Although some of the 
identified areas for improvement are outside the responsibility of East 
Power, we wanted to bring these items to the attention of management for 
their consideration.  

There is no planned Monthly Audit Meeting to discuss this report as we have 
done in the past; therefore, if you have any questions or comments and would 
like to set up a meeting with either of us, please feel free to contact us. 

Thank you

A woman called Elaine Schield (x35476) from Accounting has been calling me over the past week or two about the status of the two NYMEX seats and I told her as soon as we heard what was going to happen to them we would let her know.  She also wanted copies of the ""seat documents"".  Pursuant to my conversations with you and Mark yesterday, I left her a voicemail telling her it was now our understanding that the seats would stay with the Estate and that she needed to contact you in the future.  I left her your phone number.

I told her that the ""evidence"" of the seats consisted only of the application and the letter received back from the NYMEX approving the application.  There is no other formal evidence of the seats.  I am going to go ahead and copy the seat applications for her (except for the personal applications of Haedicke and Lavorato since it contains personal information such as bank accounts and the like).  I will generally not provide such personal information to anyone unless it is absolutely necessary to do so."

Hello John!!  HOw are you ?? How was your Holiday ?  Yes, there has been a 
tremendous ammount of talks about the Industrials asking for subsidies and 
help from the government to help lower the costs of gas...  They were asking 
for a fixed price of gas @ $3.00, or even $4.00, but the final decision was a 
loan to finance the cost of gas between IFERC and $4.00, to be paid over a 3 
to 4 year plan....I guess the final decision is not so harmful for us because 
we can still sell the derivatives, and it is a short term decision,,,What is 
really concerning me is all the noise behind it..The industrials are still 
pushing for a subsidy or a change in formula and the government is listening, 
so basically a lot of clients could eventually decide not to hedge in the 
meantime....Anyway, when do you have sometime to talk about chihuahua ? Let 
me know what is bets for you....Best regards.

Hey guys, 

Happy new year!! How are things going?  I just read an article in NGI about 
the Mexico Energy Ministry looking to possibly financing rising gas costs for 
the Mexico's industrial sector.  How does this affect Enron in Mexico?  Is 
this something that they have been talking about for sometime now?  This is 
tough on competition, right?

Have a great day and talk to you soon.  Thanks.

John

Title: The Battle of the Destination Clauses
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2378

EUROPEAN GAS REPORT-THE BATTLE OF THE DESTINATION CLAUSES
The next round in the long war over competition in European gas is being 
fought
on a new battleground-destination clauses that sit within (or alongside) many
long-term contracts for gas supply in Europe. The Directorate General for
Competition of the European Commission (DG COMP) recently said it has been
investigating several long-term take-or-pay contracts for over a year to make
sure that destination clauses fall in line with European Union (EU) 
competition
laws.

* The abolition of territorial restriction clauses would be a prelude to more
widespread renegotiation of long-term take-or-pay contracts and would bring
genuine competition in European gas markets.

* In parallel with the pressure from the competition authorities, new
commercial opportunities appear to be opening up, notably in the 
Mediterranean,
bringing further pressure to bear on the destination clauses.

I under calculated the MW capacity needed to meet the new renewable standard, and am reattaching the analysis.  The below table is the portion that was revised.  I used a 30% capacity factor since many of the new renewable resources coming on line are wind.  The MWs required could be inflated (i.e. cf of 50% v. 30%) in the out years if more biomass facilities are sited.

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the ""pulse"" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.

that is too weird, i had just started typing an email to you when i received
this from you.  glad you enjoyed the wine although you were supposed to wait
for me to come to houston to drink it.  not much new here i have just been
spending what seems like every spare minute on the beach lately and it makes
it really difficult to come to work.  this weekend was awesome, perfect
weather, great waves, etc.  i'm taking some surfing lessons next weekend,
looking forward to that.  been trying to be more active in the market
lately, still can't deal with you guys which costs me $$$ every day.
supposedly it will be worked out soon, we can deal in gas now just not in
power.  this marathon that i'm running in portland next month is
headquartered in the hilton downtown.  is the heathman the best place to
stay in that area or should i try somewhere else.  i stayed at the heathman
last time and it was ok.  making reservations right now for coer d'alene, do
i want a west facing suite (looking out at the lake)?  when it gets closer
to time you'll have to tell me what to get at the spa.  i plan on playing
golf and getting massages and doing little else.  i probably won't see a
soul from the conference except on the golf course.  i still am waiting to
hear from you when a good time would be to come to houston.  when you were
on your trip did you find a good island where i could go and no one could
ever find me and i could sit on the beach for the rest of my life drinking
pacificos?  it seems like every day that goes by i come closer to doing
it........anyways, hope all is well there, let me know what's going on with
you and what fabulous vacation you're going on next....

USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.
By Gelu Sulugiuc

07/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online 
energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a 
simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. , 
EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with 
the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks 
told Reuters on Tuesday.
The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready 
to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers 
or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper. 
""I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an 
ownership position in any other exchange platform,"" Piper said. 
With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the 
highest volume of all energy electronic platforms. Most energy trading 
platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits. 
Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day. But while 
ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline 
one can only trade with Enron. 
""It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business,"" Piper said. 
Enron is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States. 
About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic 
platform. 
""As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue 
to grow,"" Piper said. 
The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals, 
steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics. 
""We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get 
more traction,"" Piper said. ""There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't 
even tapped into yet."" 
Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success. The Atlanta-based 
exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and 
plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its 
trade volumes. 
""Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different,"" Piper 
said. ""But right now, there is room for the both of us."" 
He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE. Many of the 
energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also 
Enron's biggest clients. 
""Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one,"" Piper said. 
INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS 
Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States, 
Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of 
ways to become more successful. 
""The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline,"" Piper 
said. ""But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something 
different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional 
about it."" 
One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible 
application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different 
markets and regions. It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal. 
But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many 
exchange. 
""We want to focus in providing our markets to others,"" he said. ""In the near 
term, we're not changing that."" 
The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not 
elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it. 
EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats 
off. 
""I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't 
work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong,"" said Frank Getman, chief 
executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet. 
""If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the 
market, then people will continue to use your site."" 
Enron's stock rose 41 cents to $49.53 a share on Tuesday in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

Subject: RE-SCHEDULE NOTICE - Western Government Affairs Meeting
Importance: High

Dear All,

As a result of the recent volume of activity in Washington DC, with mediation 
proceedings, refund discussions and the need for key members of our team that 
need to attend these meetings, it has been decided to re-schedule the meeting 
of the Western Government Affairs group to Wednesday, September 12, in 
Portland, 10AM-5PM.

For those of you who had planned on attending, I am sorry to cause you this 
inconvenience.  Hopefully for those of you who wanted to attend, but 
couldn't, this will offer you the opportunity to participate on September 12.

Due to the volatility of policy related issues in our region, I would expect 
there may be some modifications to our current agenda below.  As these 
changes occur I will communicate this information to you.

Any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Subject: Draft Agenda for - Western Government Affairs Meeting

Below is a draft agenda for our planned meeting on Wednesday August 1 in 
Portland Oregon from 10-5.  Tim Belden will be joining us from11:30-1PM 
(thanks Debra) and the agenda is taking Tim's time into account.  We will be 
meeting in the Mt. Hood Room, a working lunch will be provided (thanks 
Lysa).  

If you would like to modify the agenda, please send your edits to me.

10:00   Meeting called to order - Brief Introductions - All
10:10   Overview of Western Government Affairs Priorities (Jim or designee?)
11:00   What are the short-term needs of our Western Commerical Staff? (Alan?
)
11:30   Brief Overview of July 12 Rulings and discussion of the potential 
impacts on the West (Ray/Christi/Sarah? and Group)
12:30   RTO/ISO Status Update (in alphabetical order)
  CAISO   (Sue)
  DSTAR   (Dave)
  RTO West  (Steve)
2:00 RTO Strategy discussion ""How we move forward and how we should leverage 
the recent FERC July 12 rulings""     (Group/Jim?)
3:30 Meetings, RTO's and WSCC - Ranking and Coverage coordination (Group)
4:30 Northwest OASIS ""Enhancements"" - Solicitation of Trader Comments (Dave)  
(Note, Alan, can you please ask Diana,   Sean and Bill Williams III to see if 
they can schedule time to attend?)

While developing this agenda from everyone's input I was thinking that NERC 
is beginning to assert more and more influence (good or bad) on the entire 
industry.  I would like to know if our group feels it would be useful to 
invite either Charles Yeung or Andy Rodriquez to our meeting to overview NERC 
activities and or Electronic Scheduling?

Also, if Steve Hall has any legal or contract issues he'd like to discuss 
during our meeting I'll be happy to add time for that.

Again, as noted above this is a draft and as you can see I have 
un-democratically nominated (suggested) folks for leading various 
discussions.  Any comments or confirmations of commitment to lead an agenda 
item would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for everyone's input.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Ben, please find attached revision two to the UAE - Lowell, Massachusetts 
LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility, which is to be located at an existing, 
staffed cogen facility. 

The second revisions are due to the following changes in assumptions:
1.  Further reduced the staffing costs due to no allocation of labor being 
assumed from existing plant to peaking plant and the addition of only ONE 
tech to cover the expansion O&M (per your discussion with UAE). 
2.  Restated the Annual Routine Maintenance costs components of FOM and VOM 
to 75% FOM and 25% VOM.



Please call if you have questions or want to discuss further.

regards, Scot"

Here's another draft:



Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement 
(exh. A), termination rights, term.  I also made a minor change to dispute 
resolution.  As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be 
covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very 
basic (see underlined language).  I just want to make sure we get the gas 
supply contract ASAP. We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that 
helps.  

I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.  I'll get the interconnection 
agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.

Hope you are having a good trip.

Morning Vince,

Attached, there are two today's issues of our daily market research:
1. FMT, Financial Markets Today - overview/forecast of the Major FX and
bonds markets,
2. Fixed Income Today - overview/forecasts of US treasuries, agencies, and
corporates.

Once again, I would like to suggest that I can contact your colleagues

Here are the latest documents for the assignment from ENA to LODISCO and 
HPL.  Please note the last sentence in Article 1, concerning those agreements 
that require consent, for which consent has not yet been granted.

Please let me know if these are ok to send to Anthony Wills at V&E.

Hello Vince:

My name is Fati Liamidi.  I work as an Associate in the URM group in EES. 
I have come up with an value proposition which I think could make sense for
my group and wanted to run it by one of your colleagues to see if they could 
help me out in terms of pricing. 
Would you mind directing me toward somebody in your group who would be 
willing to talk to me?  The idea involves options. 

Thanks you very much in advance.

I will serve as your representative in the year end 2000 Associates PRC 
Meeting.  ENA Management Committee  I represented some of you during the 
mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to 
represent.  

I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of 
record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and 
Associates Program.  You will note that I have asked your supervisor to 
provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as 
well as a description of your job responsibilities.  You may want to take 
charge of creating this information.  In addition to the input that I have 
requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of 
your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).  While 
the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time 
period at Enron, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I 
have some background information on you.  

My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for 
me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC 
meeting.  These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27 
and December 4.  I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those 
two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting.  

Feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process.  I will be 
out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week, but I 
will check and respond to voice mail messages.  My number is x35926.   "

It's not a 5 day notice, it's the right to recall the capacity for 5 days during the term; here's a modified paragraph.

Why is EPMI the Enron party for a financial trade?  It should always be ENA.

Calif Controller To Release Power Supply Contract Details  ????
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 09:40 AM?ET ?????
?
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California state Controller Kathleen Connell will 
release details of the state's long-term power supply contracts, including 
the cost per megawatt-hour, during a news conference Monday morning, 
according to her office. 

Connell will also discuss property taxation of utilities and possible 
anticipation of revenues in 2002 at the 2 p.m. EST news conference in 
Sacramento. 

Connell, a Democrat, has said the $13.4 billion in revenue bonds the state 
plans to sell in August to pay for electricity will last through early 2002, 
if power prices are about $195 a megawatt-hour in the summer. However, she 
said she fears prices will be much higher and the bonds will be exhausted 
sooner. 

Connell attempted to release details in February and March on the price the 
state paid to secure long-term power supply contracts, but was told by Gov. 
Gray Davis' administration that if she released the information it could 
jeopardize the deals because of its competitiveness. 

Connell has said the state should immediately stop buying power because of 
the impact it is having on the state's budget and the likelihood that other 
state-funded programs will be cut.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR THREATENS TO TAKE MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS IF
THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS NO RELIEF FOR THE STATE'S ENERGY CRISIS

ANCHORS: JULIE CHEN

REPORTERS: BILL WHITAKER

BODY:

??JULIE CHEN, anchor:

??In energy-starved California, ground zero of the power crisis, the Bush plan
faces sharp criticism. ?Bill Whitaker has that.

??BILL WHITAKER reporting:

??Six times this year lights have gone out in parts of California when heat
triggered a surge in demand. ?Governor Gray Davis deflected the political 
heat,
blasting the Bush energy plan as inadequate.

??Governor GRAY DAVIS (Democrat, California): I fault the president for not
providing California with any immediate relief.

??WHITAKER: In a major power play of his own, Davis has threatened to seize 
the
facilities of Reliant Energy, a Texas-based supplier and major Bush 
contributor,
if Reliant doesn't cut prices.

??Gov. DAVIS: But I told the generators face to face, I said, 'Your fate is in
your hands. ?If you don't help me get through this summer with a minimum of
disruptions, then you leave me no choice but to sign a windfall profits tax 
and
to seize plants.'

??WHITAKER: All five of Reliant's Southern California plants are natural gas
powered, supplying electricity to three million houses. ?Davis has called
Reliant the greediest of all the out-of-state suppliers. ?Reliant wouldn't
comment on camera, but the industry says takeover talk is more political than
economic.

??Mr. JAN SMUTNY-JONES (Independent Energy Producers Association): Seizing
private property didn't work in Cuba and it's not going to work in California,
either.

??WHITAKER: A state takeover of Reliant could backfire, scaring off other
out-of-state generators. ?But analysts say California, which already uses less
energy per capita than any other state, has few options.

??Mr. MARK BERNSTEIN (Energy Analyst, Rand Corp.): The only other thing that
can happen is for the federal government to take action to moderate prices. 
And
if the gov--federal government doesn't take those actions, the governor may 
not
have any choice.

??WHITAKER: Some California legislators suggest creating a buyers' cartel with
Washington and Oregon to jointly muscle down prices and even risk blackouts if
suppliers won't comply. ?So far Oregon and Washington aren't convinced, but
California must do something. ?Last year, electricity cost 400 percent more 
than
the year before. ?And this year, prices are rising still. ?Bill Whitaker, CBS
News, Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA'S POWER PLAN

ANCHORS: ALEX CHADWICK

REPORTERS: ELAINE KORRY

BODY:

??ALEX CHADWICK, host:

??California's rushing to get new power plants up and running. ?In January,
Governor Gray Davis used emergency powers to speed the permit process. There 
has
been progress, but NPR's Elaine Korry reports probably not enough to avoid 
more
blackouts this summer.

??ELAINE KORRY reporting:

??Since January, California energy regulators have been slashing red tape to
speed new power plants online. ?Their tracking 180 separate projects. Bob
Thurkelsen, who overseas permitting at the California Energy Commission, says
the governor's emergency directive has already paid off.

??Mr. BOB THURKELSEN (California Energy Commission): And that has allowed us
to, so far, permit 450 megawatts of new generation in a 21-day period.

??KORRY: In a few cases, even quicker than that. ?Jim Michael is the president
of Alliance Power, based in Denver, which sprinted through its permit process 
in
under three weeks.

??Mr. JIM MICHAEL (Alliance Power): Well, we're pouring concrete. ?We're on
schedule, so we're gonna have power plants operating this summer.

??KORRY: Alliance is building two small generators in Southern California.
Michael says permitting projects that used to take months were, instead,
completed in a day or two, allowing the company to meet critical deadlines.

??Mr. MICHAEL: It was essential. ?Without that streamlining, these projects
would have gone away. ?The turbines would have been sold to other projects
outside of California and so we would have essentially failed.

??KORRY: Yet there's still a major hitch. ?Despite the speedup in permitting,
California will still fall far short of the governor's initial goal. ?He 
wanted
5,000 new megawatts of electricity, enough to power five million homes, to 
come
online by July 1st. ?In a worst-case scenario, that's how much additional 
supply
the state would need to keep the lights on this summer. ?Yet only half that
amount, 2,500 megawatts, will be up and running by July. ?Jan Smutny-Jones 
heads
the industry lobbying group the Independent Energy Producers Association. 
?He's
not surprised by the shortfall.

??Mr. JAN SMUTNY-JONES (Independent Energy Producers Association): We said at
the time that was a very ambitious goal. ?And we'll see how it plays out.

??KORRY: Smutny-Jones says blackouts are a near certainty this summer. Their
severity will depend on a number of unknowns. ?How hot will it get this 
summer?
How much more can Californian's skimp on electricity? And how much wattage 
will
the power wholesalers themselves take off line? Power producers have been
charged with deliberately shutting down plants to keep prices high. 
Smutny-Jones
has a different explanation for the down time.

??Mr. SMUTNY-JONES: California's electric power system is rapidly aging. We
have not built a power plant of an appreciable amount in over a decade. ?And
there--while there's power plants being built now, the average age of these
power plants is in excess of 36 years old. ?That's the average age, which 
means
that a significant amount of the fleet is older than that. ?They break down.

??KORRY: The industry, itself, is partly to blame for the aging fleet. The
Energy Commission did license small generators during the 1990s. ?And if 
bigger
ones weren't built, it's largely because the energy producers, themselves,
balked at building them. ?Chris Seiple, with RDI Consulting, says construction
slowed everywhere; that is, until last year. ?Since 2000, he says, 90,000 new
megawatts of energy have come online nationwide. ?That's more capacity in two
years than was built during all of the 1990s. ?And now comes the Bush national
energy policy, urging even greater production. ?According to Seiple, we could
wind up with too much of a good thing.

??Mr. CHRIS SEIPLE (RDI Consulting): So we really expect that in--What?--50
markets we will go from a situation of having shortages to having too much
supply.

??KORRY: In yesterday's speech, President Bush repeated the
administration's claim that the nation will need at least 1,300 additional 
power
plants over the next two decades. ?Seiple says an over supply would drive down
prices, hurting the power wholesalers, but lower energy costs would suit most
ratepayers just fine. ?Elaine Korry, NPR News, San Francisco.

??CHADWICK: It's 19 minutes past the hour.

HEADLINE: PUC Allegations Detailed;
Hearing: The commission president tells a Senate panel that maintenance 
records
show no valid reason for generators to cut power production.

BYLINE: ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

??The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided fresh
details showing that power generators scaled back electricity production and
then benefited from the resulting high prices.

??In sworn testimony before a state Senate committee, PUC President Loretta
Lynch said the companies' behavior helped drain so much electricity from the
state's grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alerts.

??Lynch's testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that state
investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down 
unnecessarily
to create ""artificial shortages,"" often when the state was most desperate for
electricity.

??During her testimony Friday, Lynch went beyond her assertions about
unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly 
throttling
back generation.

??The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and 
brought
major utilities to financial ruin.

??Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to 
manipulate
wholesale electricity prices, including unnecessarily shutting down their 
plants
or reducing supply. The facilities, they say, are aging and have run so hard
during the state's crisis that they often require extensive maintenance.

??But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions
surrounding the generators' activities.

??Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power generation at
three plants on a single day last November. After the plants reduced 
production
during the middle of the day, the graphs show, the state was forced to declare
two separate power emergencies because electricity reserves had fallen 
seriously
low.

??The shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices. With that, the
companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity
production to almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much
higher rates.

??""We certainly see a pattern,"" Lynch told the committee, which is
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. ""Many generators are playing on their experience and 
playing,
to an extent, California.""

??Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said. She declined to
identify the power plants involved, saying only that they are owned by at 
least
two companies.

??Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who heads the special committee 
investigating
alleged market manipulation, said Lynch's information, on its face, is ""very
damning.""

??He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior.

??""We are looking at data that is suspicious,"" Dunn said.

??During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major
power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies
to increase profits.

??""There has been no collusion,"" said Jean Munoz of the Independent Energy 
Producers Assn.

??She said many of the plants bought by out-of-state generators under
California's flawed deregulation plan are more than 30 years old. The plants
have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch, she
said.

??Munoz told reporters that the plants owned by out-of-state companies last
year produced 60% more electricity than the previous year.

??Although no firm has been singled out by the PUC or the attorney general's
office, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said inspectors have visited company plants
more than 100 times this year and have found no wrongdoing. ""Mirant has run 
its
plants voluntarily and continually throughout the crisis,"" the company said 
in a
statement Friday.

??But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than 80 plants by PUC 
investigators
since December show that generators are not always producing all the power 
they
can.

??""It appears that there have been numerous instances within the past 
half-year
where generation units were not producing the amount of electricity that they
were capable of producing,"" Lynch said.

Davis Says Bad Guys Went Thataway, to Texas

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

BODY:

??When the lights go dark, this is what Gov. Gray Davis wants us to see:
President Bush and V.P. Dick Cheney smirking as their Texas pals make off with
our money.

??Shutting down power and killing jobs on their way out the door.

??This is pre-summer, a time for creating images that will stay with us 
through
the blackout season and into next year's elections.

??The image Davis is trying to implant in our senses is that of the president
and the power profiteers in collusion. Texans in cahoots. Bush and the 
bullies.

??Actually, it's an easy portrait to paint--an oil landscape with these scenes
reflecting reality:

??Bush and Cheney come from Texas oil backgrounds. Texas energy companies
bankroll Bush running for president. The companies hit a gusher in 
California's
botched deregulation. Our electricity costs soar from $7 billion in 1999 to 
$27
billion in 2000 and may top $60 billion this year. Supply and demand? Demand
increased less than 4% last year.

??Davis pleads for temporary wholesale price caps. Bush and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission won't hear of it. They also ignore California's findings
of $6.3 billion in gouging.

??Davis has been drawing this picture with increasing fervor--in a Washington
Post op-ed piece, in Saturday's official Democratic response to the 
president's
weekly radio address, in Q&As:

??""Where is that money going? Simply put, into the pockets of the generators
and marketers . . . many of them located in Texas. . . .

??""Mr. President, with all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends
in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive
responsibility to ensure energy prices are reasonable. . . .

??""Californians want to know whether you're going to be on their side. . . .
You're allowing the price-gouging energy companies to get away with murder.""

??Independent pollster Mark Baldassare puts it in context: ""We're at the point
in this crisis where people soon will begin to reassign blame.""

??Until now, fingers have been pointed at past actors--former Gov. Pete 
Wilson,
the 1996 Legislature, the private utilities. Now, present performances are 
being
scrutinized--not only Bush's, but especially Davis'. He's vulnerable for 
having
reacted slowly to the emerging crisis last summer.

??A new Baldassare poll being released today by the Public Policy Institute of
California tells the story: The familiar utilities, Wilson and the old
Legislature are blamed by 58% of Californians for the current mess. Davis and
the present Legislature, the enigmatic power generators and the Bush
administration are blamed by only 28%.

??""People are going to stop thinking about what happened five years ago and
start focusing on what's happening this year,"" Baldassare says. ""How will 
those
58% get reallocated? Their attitudes are going to be shaped in the next month 
or
so. That's what all the political maneuvering is about right now.""

??It's why Davis is starting to name generators--like Houston-based Reliant 
Energy--and tie them to the president from Texas. It's why he keeps repeating:
""Mr. President, you didn't create this problem. But you are the only one who 
can
solve it.""

??Davis also thinks it's conceivable a pressured president will reverse 
himself
and support temporary price caps. If not that, some ""creative price relief."" 
One
option, he says, is for FERC to acknowledge the massive gouging and order huge
refunds.

??Until lately, Davis had been deferential toward the new president.

??""Initially, the governor felt he could reason with the Bush administration,""
says Garry South, his political advisor. ""But he really got ticked off when it
became clear that not only was the administration unsympathetic, but most 
likely
was hanging us out to dry. Especially galling were Cheney's inaccurate and
irresponsible--not to mention haughty--comments about California.""

??Cheney recently told The Times he'd oppose price caps even if runaway energy
costs threatened the nation's economy.

??Baldassare's poll shows the political volatility. Davis' job rating has
dropped significantly since January--down from 63% approval then to 46% now,
with 41% disapproval. Only 29% approve of the way he's handling electricity; 
60%
disapprove.

??Bush's job rating is high--57% to 36%--but only 33% approve of his
performance on electricity; 56% disapprove.

??People are focused on this debacle--82% following it ""closely"" in the news.
Opinions are shifting. Images are being shaped.

??If Bush could open his mind, broaden his ideology and provide price relief--
truly be a compassionate conservative--maybe he'd be a hero.

??If not, Davis will be painting that Texas landscape all summer long.

HEADLINE: Power demands set stage for boom in backup systems

BYLINE: BY JON VAN.

BODY:

??Electricity deregulation is just one trend that's putting a big smile on the
faces of folks at Schneider Electric's North American division in Palatine 
these
days.

??There's also the rapid growth of electronic gear that requires electric
current that flows without interruption or variation, and the concern over
reliability of the public power grid.

??The new complexity is pushing electrical power from commodity status into a
new category as a resource that requires a lot of expertise, and Schneider
executives are devising strategies to take advantage of the new situation.

??Schneider, parent to the Square D brand of electrical control products, is
telling customers that it's short-sighted of them to buy transducers, circuit
breakers and the like from the lowest bidder. Instead, goes this argument, 
they
need to turn over their electrical needs to Schneider to provide an end 
solution
instead of a lot of piecemeal products.

??""We're saying you have to spend money to save money,"" said Amelia 
Huntington,
Schneider's strategic accounts vice president.

??California's electrical outages and the problems of Chicago's Commonwealth
Edison a few years ago have convinced many business managers of the wisdom of
having a back-up supply of electrical power for when the grid goes dead, she
said.

??Schneider hopes to enter some agreements with customers to own and maintain
electrical infrastructure on their premises in a fee-for-service arrangement
that goes beyond the traditional deal where Schneider sells equipment that a
customer then owns, operates and maintains.

??So far the firm hasn't sealed such a deal, but it has had talks with
customers along those lines, Huntington said. It does have several customers
that have moved away from traditional open bidding relationships with multiple
vendors.

??An example is an IBM plant that uses 130 kilovolts to fabricate computer
chips around the clock seven days a week. Any loss of power, even for a 
fraction
of a second, could cost the plant millions of dollars, Huntington said.

??""Electrical power used to be something that was a given, and manufacturers
didn't think about it much,"" Huntington said. ""But that's changing fast, and 
it
provides us with a marvelous opportunity. We are telling our customers that we
want to be their mini-powerhouse.""

??Aflutter over fiber: The upgrade of its phone networks that SBC
Communications Inc. has dubbed Project Pronto is at something of an impasse in
Illinois, but the phone giant is moving ahead with it in Texas and California.

??Executives at Ameritech claim that requirements imposed by the Illinois
Commerce Commission, which call for upgraded network facilities to be shared
with competitors, are unworkable. Consequently, they have declined to use 
Pronto
upgrades to expand the number of customers who can get high-speed Internet DSL
service.

??Elsewhere in SBC territory, the Pronto upgrades are being extended to offer
direct fiber connections to some small businesses. Plans call for SBC to offer
fiber to consumers' homes in the near future.

??While telecom strategists have talked about fiber to the home for about a
decade, SBC's plans mark the most aggressive implementation in recent memory.
Fiber provides so much information-carrying capacity that a single strand of
glass can carry TV programs, high-speed Internet and Napster music downloads
with excess capacity to spare.

??But it may not get much beyond the experimental stage, suggests a local
consultant. Scott Bender, a Chicago-based vice president of Bain & Co., said
that despite the technology lure of bringing fiber to residences, the economic
feasibility of fiber to the home remains elusive.

??The problem, Bender said, is the cost of the equipment that converts the
photons of light that travel on optical fiber into electrons that make
computers, televisions and phones work.

??""Why spend hundreds of dollars for electronics at every home?"" Bender asked.
""Instead you can bring fiber into a neighborhood and have one set of 
electronics
handle many customers, using copper wire to make the connection for the last 
few
hundred feet.

??""The fact is that copper can provide all the bandwidth that any home-based
application requires.""

??Even though Bender is skeptical that the market is ready for fiber to the

HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed 
in
the wrong direction.

??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the
economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter
horizon, according to a new poll.

??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in
early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll 
was
conducted in English and Spanish.

??The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis.

??""Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other
growth-related problems,"" said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's 
survey
director. ""This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely 
undermined
public confidence in California's future and in its leaders.""

??Change has come swiftly.

??In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the
right direction, compared to 48 percent this month.

??Other key findings include:

??-82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years 
will
make California a less desirable place to live.

??-86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's
economy.

??-43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32
percent in January. The second most popular solution, re-regulating the
electricity industry, was the favored solution in January.

??-Traffic congestion, affordable housing, air pollution and a shortage of 
good
jobs top the list of negative consequences respondents foresee from the 
state's
population growth.

HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers

BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for
millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities.

??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills, and near
the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills, is a number
called baseline, which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the 
lowest
price utilities charge.

??This number, which differs from customer to customer based on a host of
factors, is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for
electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history 
start
showing up on bills.

??""Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher, it's going to 
require
that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do
when long distance telephone service was deregulated,"" said Commissioner Carl
Wood of the Public Utilities Commission.

??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC, everyone who
exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that
additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 
percent
average hike on their overall bill, translating to an increase of roughly $85 
a
month.

??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30
percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around 
half
of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category.

??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is
underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of 
home
computers, cell phone chargers and the like.

??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and
people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes.

??""It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying 
within
baseline,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. 
""A
rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large
households.""

??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt
hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage
conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into
climatic and geographic regions.

??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and 
central
California; Edison has six in central and southern California. 

??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers 
within
each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount,
and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer 
uses
only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas).

??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction,
breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline.

??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger
allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey,
given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival.

??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family
of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes 
it
more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely,
economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to
conserve.

??""Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for
the size of the family,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.

??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. ""Does 
PG&E
come by and do bed checks?""

??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for
power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and
allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help
avoid rolling blackouts this summer.

??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president 
Loretta
Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this
coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system.

??""There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that
baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" Wood said.

??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were
smaller and many lacked central air conditioning.

??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living
standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that
average usage is different from what it was,"" Wood said.

??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for 
consumers.
There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of
those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors.

??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a 
slim
chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate 
hikes.

??""It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy
more efficiently,"" through the years, Florio said.

HEADLINE: Grid officials, others studying planned blackouts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report, a pollen count and
an electricity blackout forecast?

??It's not out of the question, say some lawmakers.

??""I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to
understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis,"" Assemblyman Fred
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy.

??Keeley compared it to ""weather forecasting, to be able to look at the next
three or four days, have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts.""

??The Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid, is
expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work.

??The idea is ""to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to
live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer,"" Keeley said.

??Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, economics professor,
released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state 
set
a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't lower the
price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said.

??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the
state's current method of ""highly disruptive random rolling blackouts"" needs 
to
be revamped.

??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities
could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for 
a
certain duration.

??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley
acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for
traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off.

??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said. ""I think we
would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient
advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources
appropriately.""

??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell 
their
unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies
short.

??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that
would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as
much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut.

??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said. ""If
businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be 
shut
off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly.""

??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be
especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops.

??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on
blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily
blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic
Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan.

??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers
three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular
period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to
nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends.

??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the
state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said.
California power consumers would in essence form ""a reverse cartel to stop the
market manipulation and the price gouging,"" she said.

??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly
concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the
extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three
cash-strapped privately owned utilities.

??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point
last week.

??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for
Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and
Electric. 

??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4
billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 
years.

As Energy Prices Rise, So Does the Rancor;
Politics: Gov. Davis says power plan comes at the expense of consumers. Bush
blames Democrats for environmental curbs.

BYLINE: EDMUND SANDERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??President Bush and Democratic leaders decried the rising cost of energy
Saturday, but Bush implicitly blamed Democrats for outmoded environmental
restrictions while Democrats explicitly blamed Bush for favoring the energy
industry over consumers.

??Speaking for Democrats, California Gov. Gray Davis said the energy plan that
the president unveiled Tuesday would do nothing to alleviate the immediate
threats of rising gasoline prices and blackouts in California.

??The president's plan ""simply favors more energy production at the expense of
everything else,"" said Davis, who has unsuccessfully lobbied the Bush
administration to temporarily cap wholesale prices until new power plants can 
be
brought on line.

??Davis, whose popularity has sunk during the crisis, noted that companies 
from
Bush's home state of Texas were the targets of most allegations of 
price-gouging
in California by out-of-state energy suppliers.

??""Mr. President, runaway energy prices are not just a California problem,""
Davis said. ""With all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends in 
the
energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility
to ensure that energy prices are reasonable.""

??Bush so far has tried to stay above the fray, letting his aides respond to
criticisms. ""It's time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a
positive new consensus,"" the president said Saturday in his weekly radio
address.

??But the rancor is certain to continue. The Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee on Saturday announced the launch of a monthlong radio and television
advertising campaign targeting Republican lawmakers whom they blame for not
doing enough to ease the energy crunch.

??The campaign specifically criticizes Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Long Beach) for
opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. It is scheduled to start 
Monday
with a 30-second spot that ends with a message urging viewers to call Horn's
offices for immediate action.

??""California's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted 
and
rate hikes of up to 80%,"" the ad states. ""Yet President Bush has offered no
relief to hard-pressed ratepayers. . . . Our representative, Steve Horn, has
joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. Call Horn
and tell him we need action now.""

??Mark Nevins, a committee spokesman, said the ad campaign is part of an 
effort
to hold Horn and fellow Republicans accountable for lack of leadership on the
energy issue.

??""Horn's party controls the House, the Senate and the White House--and they
have yet to do a thing to provide some immediate relief to California's
families,"" Nevins said.

??House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) called on Bush on Saturday
to endorse temporary price caps to stop what he termed 10- and even 20-fold
increases in Californians' energy bills.

??Appearing on CNN's ""Evans, Novak, Hunt & Shields,"" Gephardt also said Bush
should have included his tax incentives for energy conservation in the giant 
tax
cut bill that is moving through Congress.

??""The good parts of his plan are not in his budget and not in his tax bill,
which really makes a mockery of what he's really suggesting,"" Gephardt said.
""We're putting through this week, supposedly, a $1.3-trillion tax 
cut--probably
the biggest tax cut in our history. And there's not a penny in it for the 
energy
stuff that he suggested this week.""

??The president's energy plan calls for greater production of power and fuel,
tax breaks for conservation and construction of new nuclear plants.

??Two of its most controversial elements are opening Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge for drilling and giving federal agencies power to force
landowners to sell property needed for new electricity transmission lines.

??Responding to growing complaints from environmentalists, Bush insisted that
new technologies would enable the nation to boost energy production without
hurting the environment.

??""Too often, Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and
environmental protection,"" Bush said. ""The truth is, energy production and
environmental protection are not competing.""

Spencer Abraham Is Running on Energy, Not Charisma;
Profile: Charged with selling Bush's initiative, 'workhorse' new to the field 
is
facing a hard row.

BYLINE: FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??Now that President Bush's energy plan has been pondered, penned and rolled
out, the task of selling it to the American people falls in large part to a
48-year-old father of three who drives a green Chrysler minivan and jokes of
having ""a face made for radio.""

??Spencer Abraham, the man who accepted the job of Energy secretary knowing
precious little about energy, takes his place as promoter in chief for the 
plan
designed to ""finally put America on the right course,"" as he likes to put it.

??It was Vice President Dick Cheney who conceived the 105-point blueprint,
engineered over pots of coffee at an ornate 19th century table in his office.
Now Cheney cedes the spotlight to Abraham, a self-described ""workhorse, not 
show
horse"" whose admitted lack of charisma helped cost him his Senate seat last 
year
after just one term as a Michigan congressman.

??Abraham, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, wears his shoes until they 
wear
out and gets haircuts when his staff reminds him. His idea of a good time is 
hot
dogs with his wife, son and twin daughters in the food court of a Virginia
shopping mall.

??""It's not a charismatic plan, so it doesn't require a charismatic guy,"" said
William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine who 
served
with Abraham on former Vice President Dan Quayle's staff. ""He is of
working-class origins; not a glib talker. He'll have a shrewd sense of how to
sell this plan, as well as a real understanding of it.""

??On the eve of the energy plan's unveiling Thursday, Abraham was the only
administration spokesman trotted out for the network news. Friday he made the
rounds of morning TV news shows, delivering the party line that conservation
alone will not solve the problem, that more energy sources must be generated.

??And on the Op-ed pages of Friday's Wall Street Journal, he sought to counter
complaints that the plan is anti-environment and would only help big business.

??""Americans love and want an unlimited supply of affordable energy, but they
don't like virtually each of the sources that provide it,"" Abraham said in a
recent interview. ""Coal is too dirty, nuclear isn't safe, hydropower kills 
fish,
windmills threaten birds.""

??His mission is to persuade the people otherwise. It is a job that comes with
little power and lots of room for blame.

??The Department of Energy, which then-Sen. Abraham sought to abolish in 1999,
shares splintered authority with several other agencies. What it does command 
is
often controversial: the nuclear weapon labs that came under scrutiny after
security breaches at its Los Alamos, N.M., facility and oversight of the
nation's aging nuclear arsenal.

??But his greatest challenge is likely to come this summer in California, when
anticipated electricity shortages will cause the lights to go out, air
conditioners to shut down and whopping utility bills to arrive in the mail.

??Then Abraham is poised to become California's pinata, the federal official
who gets the stick because, Bush administration critics will argue, the 
federal
government has failed to deliver the caps on wholesale power rates that Gov. 
Gray Davis and others have sought.

??""The public is getting ready to be hit with a rate increase, and they are
going to be mad as the devil,"" said a former member of Congress familiar with
energy policy who declined to be identified to avoid offending the
administration.

??Critics point to Abraham's lack of energy background as his greatest
weakness. But what Abraham brought to his post--and what should serve him
well--is political savvy, his supporters say. He headed the Michigan state
Republican Party during most of the 1980s and joined Quayle's staff in 1990. 
He
returned to Michigan to launch his Senate bid in 1993 and rode 1994's 
nationwide
GOP tide into office.

??Abraham's voting record generally reflected the GOP congressional agenda: He
loyally opposed abortion rights and favored free trade; his environmental 
record
earned him the Sierra Club's lowest rating. But he made his mark by 
successfully
challenging party leaders when they sought to reduce legal immigration to the
United States.

??He spent more time working in the back rooms of Congress than in its
limelight. He likes to tell the story of one early turn presiding over the
Senate when he forgot about the live microphone and was caught on C-SPAN 
humming
the children's song, ""Do You Know the Muffin Man?""

??His supporters note he's a quick study, a Harvard-educated lawyer who has
mastered the subject of energy in mere weeks. He starts work early and stays
late, presenting his staff with checklists of things to do and ideas to 
explore.
He has a knack for distilling an arcane science into language the public can
understand.

??He may need all the communication skills he can muster to confront one of 
his
most awkward tasks: telling the nation's most populous state it must solve its
energy problem largely on its own.

??""California keeps saying, 'Why won't Washington do something?' "" Abraham
said, reiterating his opposition to electricity price caps he believes will 
only
prolong the crisis. But he added: ""The first call I made as secretary of 
Energy
was to Gov. Davis. . . . We're not leaving any stones unturned.""

??If Abraham was not practiced in front of the camera in his early career, he
seems to be now. His performance has earned high marks at the White House, 
aides
said.

??Not much briefing was required before he traveled with Bush to Minnesota for
the energy plan's debut. He already knew the material, a staff member said. 
And
he had gotten a haircut.

Davis Launches Conservation Campaign;
Electricity: Governor hands out fluorescent lightbulbs in his effort to get
Californians to save power this summer.

BYLINE: DALONDO MOULTRIE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis' visit to Estella Burnett's Venice home Saturday had nothing
to do with her steps at conserving energy. She was already doing her part.

??But Davis asked her to do more.

??The governor stopped at one other home in Burnett's neighborhood to help
distribute compact fluorescent lightbulbs as part of the kickoff of 
""PowerWalk,""
a program designed to encourage California residents to conserve electricity 
during the state's energy-strapped summer.

??Members of the California Conservation Corps began distributing the energy
efficient bulbs across the state Saturday. The plan is to deliver 1.5 million 
of
them door-to-door in the next 17 weeks.

??The effort was welcomed at homes in Venice but residents, including Burnett,
said more needs to be done.

??""I think the lightbulbs might help, but it's up to us to conserve,"" Burnett
said after Davis left her home, adding that the Legislature can also do more.
""They can build more power plants so we don't have to take up their slack.""

??Conservation Corps members also visited the home of Owen Thomas, 25.

??The idea of handing out the bulbs struck Thomas as a novel, proactive way to
spread the message of energy conservation, he said.

??To maximize his energy conservation efforts, Thomas limits his use of 
lights,
he said. But he said still more needs to be done.

??""I doubt that's how people use [the bulk of] their energy,"" Thomas said.

??He said he cuts back on use of lights and his computer and doesn't use his
air conditioners.

??Davis also paid a visit to the home of John Ghanie, 58, who lives across the
street from Burnett.

??Ghanie said Davis' PowerWalk campaign is a good idea but he, too, believes
other steps must be taken.

??""I think he is trying to do something,"" Ghanie said. ""It should have been
done years ago. The lightbulbs are good, but we need [power] plants. This is
like a Band-Aid. We need a cure.""

??Davis said he is committed to providing more energy to the state by
authorizing construction of 15 plants, 10 of which are being built.

??He said California legislators are doing all they can to fight the energy
battle.

??President Bush needs to step in and help California deal with the crisis,
Davis said.

??Burnett, 66, said she is happy to help in attempts at conservation. ""I wash
clothes at night,"" she said. ""We very seldom turn on the television; only to
turn on the news. I use the dishwasher maybe once every other week.""

HEADLINE: One year later, we know it wasn't just a simple game of golf

BYLINE: Dan Walters

BODY:

??California will mark - but certainly not celebrate - an anniversary this
week. It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over San
Diego, and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power, San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. began charging its customers high, market-oriented rates 
for
juice.

??It was the beginning of the California energy crisis, or at least of public
and political awareness that something was wrong. And a year later, every 
aspect
of the crisis continues to grow worse. We are paying 10 times as much for 
power
as we were two years ago. We have amassed more than $20 billion in private and
public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consumer power rates.
And we face potentially life-threatening summer blackouts.

??Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year. They go
back to decisions in the 1970s to stop major power plant construction and rely
on conservation and alternative generating sources. And they include a 
momentous
decision in the mid-1990s to adopt a ""deregulation"" plan that was an 
unworkable
hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the mercy of
out-of-state generators. Of more currency is what was and wasn't done in the
last 12 months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled, and perhaps
uncontrollable, firestorm.

??Gov. Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays
golf, ""one hole at a time."" Unfortunately for Davis, and for the state, it was
not a golf game, but one of three-dimensional, and perhaps four-dimensional,
chess. To manage the crisis effectively, the Democratic governor needed the
ability, either personally or through trusted aides, to pull together its
disparate elements into a cohesive whole.

??The golfing approach was evident from the beginning, as Davis dealt with 
only
the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved, rather than
embracing it wholly and actively. Private and public energy experts warned 
that
what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and 
proposed
that the 1996 ""deregulation"" be suspended, that rates be raised slightly and
that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into long-term supply
contracts to stabilize the market. But Davis and his handpicked state Public
Utilities Commission president, Loretta Lynch, stalled for time.

??Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced, the PUC voted 3-2 to
authorize long-term supply contracts at about 5 cents a kilowatt-hour - 
slightly
higher than wholesale prices had been, but ridiculously cheap by contemporary
standards. Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price escalation and 
quickly
locked up long-term supplies, but Lynch denounced the commission action as ""a
wrong turn"" that could lead to higher consumer bills, and within days it was
scuttled in legislation signed by Davis.

??Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively, Davis, Lynch and
the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego, rolling back retail
rates without addressing either supply or cost issues. Within weeks, private
utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesale
costs skyrocketed.

??Last summer's failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment. 
It's
clear now, for example, that it was a mistake for the state to continue buying
power at sky-high rates when the utilities had exhausted their credit. Having 
a
new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the market would
bear.

??A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud, but didn't, Davis 
is
busily rewriting history and blaming others, principally Republicans, for the
dilemma. But the governor cannot, or should not, escape the responsibility for
approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf, or like some
routine political dispute, and thus failing to apply the aggressive and
sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset.

??As Gen. George McClellan discovered at the Battle of Antietam during the
Civil War, the unwillingness to take risk often leads to greater carnage.

Power firms fueled by greed, Lockyer says;

Out-of-state generators face multiple probes

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Up the road in Folsom, at the nondescript headquarters of the Independent 
System
Operator -- monitor-in-chief of California's energy grid -- they have a new 
job:
responding to more than 40 detailed subpoenas.

???The data the ISO keeps on electricity transactions are central to the
half-dozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various
parts of the state's energy mess, including possible criminal activity by 
power
generators.

???""They're asking for everything and then some,"" a spokeswoman for the ISO,
Stephanie McCorkle, said, sighing.

???The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state Public Utilities
Commission, the Assembly, the Senate, the state attorney general and a phalanx
of state and federal auditors all are boring into California's energy mess.

???The main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of
power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the
electron-starved state.

???Although most investigators say the ISO's logs and bid records show the
various generators used their market share to drive up prices, the issue is
whether they did so acting collaboratively, either directly or indirectly.

???Generators deny any manipulation of the market. They say their prices 
simply
reflect a lack of supply, plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas.

???But that hasn't stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong.

???Attorney General Bill Lockyer has been probing the actions of the 
generators
since August to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair 
business
practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior.

???""We all feel we've been taken advantage of, been gouged,"" Lockyer said. 
""The
question is whether it's legal greed or illegal greed. There's no question 
it's
greed.""

???Lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like Reliant Energy Inc. and
Dynegy, which have refused to disclose internal company information that 
Lockyer
subpoenaed Feb. 15.

???The power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents
Lockyer wants will be kept confidential.

???Lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this
summer.

???The PUC also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns
to drive up prices.

???On Thursday, PUC President Loretta Lynch said investigators found patterns
of plant shutdowns that created ""artificial shortages.""

???Lockyer insisted that ""no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or
criminal suit. But we're probably further along than any other investigative
effort.""

???Generators say they are cooperating with the investigations -- except for
worries about proprietary information becoming public -- and flatly reject the
notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert.

???""We naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations,"" 
said
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston. ""It doesn't 
compute
because we all compete against each other. We don't cooperate, share 
information
or anything of that nature. It's not only illegal but unethical to do so.""

???Said Chuck Griffin, a Mirant Corp. spokesman: ""Any patterns would exist
because of the rules they established long before Mirant was in California.""

???A new investigation of the generators is being done also by the aptly named
Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale
Energy Market. It too is meeting resistance from generators in handing over
documents they consider confidential.

???""Discussions thus far in that regard have been disturbing, and right now
we're at an impasse,"" said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's 
chairman.

???Dunn's committee can only gather facts and make recommendations on new laws
if it uncovers some kind of anti-competitive activity not already covered by 
the
law.

???So far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the only entity to
impose any economic pain on generators.

???After a probe of California's power market last summer, the commission
issued an order in December that created a mechanism by which generators would
have to justify prices above a certain level determined by the commission.

???In March, the commission said generators had to justify $124 million in
charges -- or reimburse the money.

???It also reached an $8 million settlement with AES Southland and Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading over power plants that were supposed to be running
but weren't.

???Critics, from Gov. Gray Davis down, say that generators owe many millions
more in refunds.

???Several other investigations are either under way or completed.

???The PUC is investigating whether the holding companies of Pacific Gas and
Electric, Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy in San Diego violated 
the
requirement that the utility be their first spending priority.

???The investigation came after discoveries that while PG&E and Edison were
accumulating huge debts buying power, they were also transferring hundreds of
millions to their parent companies.

??--------------------------------------------------------------------------

???Probes sparked by power crisis

???Here's a look at some of the investigations California's power crisis has
sparked and their status:

???Market manipulation by power generators -- The Public Utilities Commission,
attorney general and a special Senate committee are all investigating
allegations.

???High prices charged by generators -- The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission said in March that generators must justify $124 million in possible
overcharges or refund the money. The investigation is still open.

???Investor-owned utilities transferring large sums to their holding companies
-- The PUC is examining whether any regulations were violated.

???The flaws of electrical deregulation -- The state auditor general completed
a report in March.

???Audits of the utilities -- A report concluding utilities transferred
millions to parent companies was released in January by the PUC.

???Price spikes in natural gas -- An Assembly committee issued its report last
week, saying El Paso Corp. manipulated the market.E-mail Greg Lucas at

HEADLINE: Power juggling ramped up price;

Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur

BODY:
Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages,
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy industry
workers.

???Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that
are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported
by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle.

???The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times
as much as a year ago.

???Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third.

???Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, 
said
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of
constricting supply.

???But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only 
were
generators shut down to boost prices but these ""gaming"" tactics contributed to
the plants' deteriorating condition.

???""We suspected it,"" said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for
the ISO. ""It was a sure factor in driving up prices."" Such swings in unit
output, he said, ""would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to
game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units
up.""

???Unusual phone calls

???Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy
Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's
headquarters in Houston.

???According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then
increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as
four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity
production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as
spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units 
back
up.

???""They would tell us what to do, and we would do it,"" said one of the men,
who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear
being fired. ""Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change.""

???The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of
the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market.

???""It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO,"" said Carl
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that
agency's investigation into plant outages. ""Instead of being responsive to
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability.""

???Corporate denial

???Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism 
to
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES
Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have asserted
that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, decrepit power
plants harder than ever to meet California's needs.

???While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance.

???""As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California
market design, we are required to do that,"" said Kevin Frankeny, an operations
official with Reliant. ""When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), they dispatch 
on
a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour.""

???Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it
first.

???The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid
managers. ""ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that,"" said one of
the operators. ""Not for an individual unit.""

???Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into
whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar 
with
the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to have been done 
to
drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business practices laws.

???Invisible practice

???How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught?

???One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually
invisible to regulators and grid operators.

???When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a
certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based 
on
an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount
of energy required.

???The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after 
their
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO.
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the
output was back at the expected level.

???Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that 
if
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain
at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the price was 
low,
output was brought down and kept down.

???The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more
aggressive than others.

???""What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they
would undergenerate,"" an operator said. ""Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go
up.

???""Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), 
they'd
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 'Bring
it down again.' ""

???Rapid changes

???These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison
were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of the 
workers
said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which also reduced
wear and tear.

???""They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the
brakes on,"" said one of the operators. ""They were increasing the fatigue on 
the
units.""

???ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than
the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when companies 
were
withholding power.

???But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in
driving up energy prices.

???A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost
among those companies.

???Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted
for more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity
from all sources.

???Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was
followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. (278) 
and
Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261).

???Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for
1.4 million homes for one hour.

???Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 
days,
accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an operator
who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of
legitimate equipment failures.

???Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California
plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants
could remain in service during times of high summer demand.

???But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit
offline because of the problem.

???Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant 
to keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary
maintenance.

???Ramping may be rampant

???Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an
operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said
the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling calls 
came
from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in Minneapolis, he 
said.

???Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied
the company was engaged in gaming the California market.

???In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the
""major beneficiaries of high real-time prices"" that spring.

???One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price
was not met.

???On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to 
be
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt hour,
even though the legal price cap at the time was $750.

???""The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' "" the source said.

HEADLINE: EDITORIAL;

On energy;

Conservation's value: It's not all sacrifice

BODY:
IN ENERGY-SPEAK, conservation can be a dangerous word. The White House 
point-man
on energy, Vice President Dick Cheney, demonizes the term to heap scorn on
anything short of more drilling and mining.

???For Gov. Gray Davis, conservation also gets special handling. Too much
emphasis on lower thermostats and higher gas mileage and voters start thinking
painful sacrifice and a lower standard of living. The image of President 
Carter
swaddled in a cardigan, talking up frugal consumption was a political disaster
for Democrats.

???Small wonder that neither party is enthusiastic about conservation. But
saving energy -- electricity, natural gas and oil -- has never been more
necessary and obtainable.

???Thrift, efficiency and innovation aren't threats to the economy or anyone's
lifestyle. Conservation needs serious advocacy, not lipservice.

???There is no better place to boost energy savings than in California, the
cynosure of the power crisis. The shortage has the potential to direct
California toward power efficiency on an even greater scale. Generation,
transmission and pricing are all under the microscope.

???Already, this state is a leader, with the second-lowest per capita use of
energy in the nation, thanks to building and lighting guidelines pioneered 
over
the last several decades. California now has no choice but to stay out front.

???Appliances, industrial and farming equipment, transportation and building
codes were revolutionized by the oil shortages of the 1970s. The state drew up
car manufacturing guidelines mandating alternative fuels to boost mileage and
cut tailpipe smog. Jobs were created.

???The efficiencies were partly dictated by price, as consumer costs surged
during the Arab oil embargo and then the Iranian revolution. Buyers wanted
products with smaller energy appetites and manufacturers responded.

???But government also played a major role. The state set up rules to spur
industry to squeeze more results out of less energy. These directives worked: 
a
soda can is just as cold in a new refrigerator using a third of the juice of a
'70s era model. Mandated insulation, fluorescent lighting and
weatherstripping pay off. There's no sacrifice in comfort or performance.

???Amid the current power shortage, this message is only partially sinking in.
For months, Sacramento has dithered through a debate that has rung up a $6
billion price tag, the sum paid out by the state to buy power. None of this
money has gone to conservation.

???This week, higher rates were approved by state regulators to repay the
enormous outlays in energy buys and also to send a price signal to users. 
Higher
rates should be a strong impetus to conserve.

???But bigger bills aren't the total solution. For one thing, the rates were
reworked to favor industrial users, the same group that pushed the state's
disastrous deregulation plan that underlies the shortage. For this group to
receive special treatment is unconscionable.

???At best, the money buys time to get California through a blackout-prone
summer. Up to a dozen new power plants are under construction, with the hope
that by next year supply will be in balance with daily demand. Plainly, the
state badly needs to find new power and its power infrastructure should be
updated.

???But the mad scramble for electrons risks missing out on a larger 
opportunity
to devise rules, require new equipment and encourage methods that conserve
power. A long-term initiative to build-in conservation is missing. The Bush
energy plan does little on this score.

???Instead, conservation is being treated tentatively. Gov. Gray Davis has
directed $800 million toward nearly a dozen energy-saving programs. These
include buybacks of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners, 
replacement
of older agricultural water pumps and weatherizing upgrades for low-income
homes.

???These are reasonable steps to soften an immediate crisis. Already the
state's energy use has dropped by 7-to-9 percent through public awareness of 
the
power shortage.

???But conservation needs a more vigorous push from Davis and Bush. What's
missing is long-range thinking, a willingness to legislate changes and 
political
courage.

???Consider the ""qualifying facilities,"" or small, independent power plants
that feed into the state's market. For months, these generators -- many using
alternative methods such as wood waste, wind or small gas turbines -- have 
been
stiffed by cash-poor big utilities. The small suppliers have largely shut 
down,
worsening the statewide shortage and crimping an industry competing with big
generators. Davis should make every effort to restore the small producers to
financial health.

???Another opportunity is technology. For decades, the homely electric meter
has stayed pretty much the same, measuring the monthly energy use of homes and
businesses. What if this caveman gizmo were modernized and could give users an
hour-by-hour picture of energy habits?

???On a grander scale, gas mileage needs re-thinking. The Bush energy package
steered attention to its subsidies for alternative-fuel cars, but ignored the
biggest challenge: plugging loopholes that allow SUV's and light trucks to 
burn
more gas than cars.

???Research and governmental directives have made vehicles safer and more
thrifty to operate. A continued push from Washington could innovate even
further, if the president was genuinely concerned about conservation.

???Ending the energy crisis will likely take a batch of ingredients. In
predicting the future, many analysts bank on a mix of solutions: new power
plants, higher rates, state bonds to spread out $13 billion in power buys, 
and,
finally, conservation. It's a term that usually comes last.

???But a longe-range strategy needs devising that will enable California's
homes, factories and farms to conserve on power use. The state has faced the
challenge before and triumphed. It's time to try again.

Four Longhorn Substitutes Leaving Team; UT Will Sign at Least 22

Three Longhorn reserves

- sophomore CB Kendrick Turner, sophomore LB Jamal
Joyner and redshirt freshman DB Antonio Moore
- have quit the football team
and will transfer to other schools, and a fourth backup
- redshirt freshman
FB Jason Barron
- will miss the 2000 season for academic reasons.
Barron said he will work to improve his grades and return to the team, but
I
would be surprised if he comes back because he is far down on the fullback
chart and the Longhorns probably will sign at least 22 players in February.
With 80 players on scholarship and only 13 seniors, they will need to have
some more players leave next year to stay within the NCAA's 85-scholarship
limit.
None of the departures came as a surprise and Turner was the only one of
the
quartet who would have seen any meaningful action this season if he had
stayed. Joyner was on suspension. He was the last to leave of the four
players who were suspended prior to the Cotton Bowl game.
Brown wished all of the young men well, and gave the three who are
transferring unconditional releases.
* * * *
Eric Hall, 6-3, 235, 4.5, the outstanding DE prospect from Clarksville,
Tenn., told me today he is going to take his official visit to Texas the
Sept. 9 weekend and will see the season-opening game against
Louisiana-Lafayette. He said he strongly favors Texas, and the only other
schools he is considering are Nebraska and Tennessee.
""I see myself going to Texas,"" he said. ""I was born in Texas (Fort Hood)
and
I really like the state.""
Another top out-of-state DE who is strongly considering Texas is Kaelen
Jakes,  6-4, 265, 4.8 of Valencia, Cal. He lived in Texas for  four years
and
said he is considering the Horns, along with USC, UCLA, Arizona and
Nebraska.
He said his team doesn't keep invidual stats, but estimated he had ""between
15
and 18 sacks last season."" He said he played DE, DT and NG for Valencia
last
year.
* * * *
DT Tommie Harris of Killen Ellison is the top DL in Texas this year and is
one of the top players in the country. He says he favors Texas over Florida
State and others. Harris has been working out in Houston with a personal
trainer this summer. UT center signee Trey Bates works out with the same
trainer. Stockar McDougle, a former Oklahoma Sooner OL who now is in the
NFL,
is Harris' cousin, and is paying for the personal trainer for Harris.
* * * *
Texas has 11 early commitments, including six offensive linemen. The OLs
are
Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan Scott
of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of
Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn
JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal
Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric
Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian
Carter of The Woodlands.
Ten players who signed with Texas are slated to play in the annual
North-South High School Football All-Star game at Rice Stadium next Tuesday
at 7 p.m. Scheduled to play for the North are QBs Chance Mock of The
Woodlands and Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest, WRs Roy Williams of Odessa
Permian, B. J. Johnson of South Grand Prairie and Nathan Vasher of
Texarkana
and kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell.
Scheduled to play for the South are OT Lionel Garr of Diboll, C Trey Bates
of
Fort Bend Elkins and DTs Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier and Marcel Moses of
Texas City. Davis and Moses failed to qualify academically and are headed
to
the JC ranks. Johnson has a sprained ankle that will keep him out of the
game.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorn DBs are extremely impressed with Sloan Thomas
and Tony Jeffery, who are two of the outstanding incoming freshman wide
receiver prospects. They said Thomas is a big, physical receiver with great
speed, and they say Jeffery is very hard to cover because he has such great
moves and quickness. The players have been working out against each other
during voluntary summer drills.
* * * *
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL RECRUITING: CoCo Reed, a 5-11 forward from Houston
Jersey
Village, has committed to play for the Texas women. She averaged 19 points
as
a junior and averaged 23 points in AAU play this summer. She lives with 5-6
junior point guard Nina Norman, who will be one of the nation's top
prospects
next year. Reed also was recruited by Duke, LSU, Rutgers, Florida and
Maryland, among others.
The Longhorn women's top incoming freshmen
- 6-1 Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro
and 6-2 Annissa Hastings of San Antonio Sam Houston
- were named to the AAU
All-American Team Saturday at the conclusion of the National AAU Tournament
in Clarksville, Tenn.

I have two questions:

(1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, 
won't Greg Johnston need a ""short course"" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was 
thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.

(2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana 
has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though 
Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch."

Subject: RE: InternetWeek


Gentlemen -- 

The background on this message from Greg relates to his potential involvement 
in an advisory board for Internet Week magazine.  Essentially, this means 
that Greg would attend a couple of meetings per year and participate in a 
handful of telephone conversations all aimed at helping the editors at 
InternetWeek calibrate themselves in terms of what's important and what's not 
in the technology world.  Here are the advantages I see:

Greg gets to work with several high-level CTO's and technology CEO's who also 
participate on the board.  This is good exposure for our plans to provide IT 
services as a business.
Good exposure in terms of IT recruiting.  The more high-profile places we 
are, the better.
Good media relations and the potential for us to track editorial thought in 
the technology world.

Philippe had originally planned to do it, but I think we're concluding that 
it's a perfect place for Greg to be as part of his efforts to put new 
origination activities in motion.  

From my PR perch, I see no conflicts but Greg is right to suggest that we run 
it by you first.  Ok with you?

Dear Steve --

It was good talking with you before Christmas, and I have been trying to
follow the California power story closely since then.

I would like to propose going ahead with the plan we discussed for a
one-month trial.

Our fee would be $5000.

For this amount, Doug Gamble or I would send you some material twice a week:
a few jokes, anecdotes, or funny reactions to the ongoing story.
Additionally, we will work with a cartoonist the White House Writers Group
works with regularly, and we will try to send you two or three
editorial-type cartoons over the month of January.

To make this work, it would be helpful if you could send Doug and I a daily
email of news clips related to the story, or any article or report you would
like to which you would like to draw our attention.

If this arrangement is acceptable to you, please let me know by email or
phone.

This could be a fun project and I look forward to working with you on it.

Daniel

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC.

The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent
with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to
enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and
discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put

I'm ready for the fishing!  I was able to ride on Joe's boat after he got it, very nice.  It should run very skinny.

I hope all is well.

Thanks for the invite.  I wish I could make it.  You need to plan a trip
down here for a little fin and feather.  Joe got himself a nice custom
flats and we need to break it in right.  A lot of geese and ducks are
being killed on lake Mathis right now and I'm sure we can manage to find
some trout somewhere.

Happy birthday and drink one for me.

I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.  

Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a 
certain specification.



I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to 
these as ""Equipment"" and part of the ""Units"" so it is clear that the 
warranties apply.

Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the 
units utilizing these stacks?

Thanks.? I have changed the party to the parent of the two entities in 
question and put the project particulars in the introductory paragraph.? 
Otherwise, all of your changes were fine.? You can go ahead and have the 
agreement executed and fax or send over.

Doug, 

Here's the revised CA.? I highlighted the changed terms.? In addition, I 
deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
prior CA. 

I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,? but 
obviously I left that for you to determine.? I expect that the Enron entity 
which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity. 

(See attached file: InterGen North America CA may 18.doc) 

I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the 
complexity of the issues, and I added 6 months to? the term since things 
won't get cranked up for a while. 

I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.? Have a good weekend.

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation."

This is a problem your people should be aware of because I think our usual 
practice when we want to verify ownership structure is to call the corporate 
secretary's office.  If they are behind, I don't know who we should go to in 
the future.  Maybe we need to run everything by corp. tax from now on.  Ugh.

Subject: Corporate Secretary's Data Sheets

The erroneous statements found in the Form 2 related to Transwestern today 
are traceable in part to the fact that the Corporate Secretary's Data Sheets 
are months behind in their accuracy.  This is not the first instance where 
serious and costly errors have been made by persons who were relying on the 
data sheets for accurate ownership information on Enron Corp. subsidiaries.

If you have any creative ideas on finding a remedy for the extremely long lag 
time between the submission of final documentation to the Corporate Secretary 
and the updating of the sheets, please let me know.  In the meantime, be 
aware that the information is not necessarily reliable.

Thanks

Rod,
 Per your request this morning, it turns out you can't swing a dead cougar 
around here in GPG HR without hitting a U of H grad!  
 Kristin Passmore, an HR Assistant whom you may not have met yet, as well as 
Estalee and Laura all are University of Houston graduates in good standing.  
(Well, Laura barely is in good standing, but I'll let her be the one to tell 
you all about that.)  In addition, Miranda Southard, a student learner in our 
department, will be a senior this Fall at U of H. 
 Each of these good people has expressed an interest in helping you with any 
recruiting efforts directed at U of H alumni.  
 
  d.s.

I would like to know if  I could take a class in the fall from 7:00- 8:15 
a.m. ?  I would be in at 8:30 and it would be two days a week .  I would stay 
late to make up for that time. Rain comes in at 7:30 and Felecia gets here at 
8:00, so the phones would be covered.  Please let me know as soon as 
possible, as registration is this week.

Thanks

Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of 
credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the 
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is 
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back 
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced 
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two 
NPV's.

Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

Stinson

Dear Greg:
I met you briefly about six weeks ago in Cliff's office - I was leaving as
you were coming in.

I am an executive recruiter with Management and Capital Partners. I have
done a great deal of work in the energy industry - I will send you some
information on me and my company via FedEx .

I will be in Houston May 30 - June 1 and would love the opportunity to sit
down with you for a few  minutes. I will call your office later in the week
to set up an appointment.

Cheers,
Barbara

Greetings:

Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California 
Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California 
Chamber of Commerce.

Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally 
supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information 
regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday 
morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring 
Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.

Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall 
package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though 
he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former 
Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business 
Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing 
we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read ""grow up"") 
and do a comprehensive deal.

Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with 
him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.

We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support 
and pitch:

1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve 
this now, and 
2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've 
described.   

They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before 
they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly 
didn't reject the idea.

Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.

Best,
Jeff"

Paul is right and so am I. Legal unbundling is exactly what you say it is; 
but that still entails a change of ownership, perhaps not ultimate ownership, 
but at least structure (as you put it, a 'separate corporate entity'). If one 
looks at the jurisprudence in the Transparency Directive Case, a requirement 
to make accounts transparent and unbundled was OK, but by implication a 
requirement to legally unbundle was not.

In passing, the Transparency Directive Case is the thing to mention if anyone 
ever argues that nuclear power is not subject to State Aid rules. In that 
case, the French argued that introducing transparency into EdF accounts would 
contravene the Euratom treaty as EdF was a nuclear producer.  The Commission 
wanted transparency in order to enforce the state aid rules under the EC 
rules. France lost. The Court said that any entity that was supplying into a 
commercial market was subject to the EC rules.  You often still see the myth 
that nuclear power is outside the state aid rules.

Brendan: 
 Paul is right that we (and DG TREN more importantly!) use the term ""legal 
unbundling"" to denote placing of transmission function in a separate 
corporate entity with ""Chinese walls"" built around it (viz. accompanying 
requirements to achieve that in draft acceleration directive.) We use the 
term ""ownership unbundling"" to denote alienation of shares in a transmission 
company to separate (though possibly overlapping) shareholders, thereby 
achieving a differentiation of control as between it and the supply and 
generation/ production/ importation functions. A forced change of ownership 
is claimed by the German cos. to be contrary to the German federal 
constitution and by EdF and GdF to require amendments to the French 
nationalisation legislation passed just after World War II.
 I will leave you to answer Paul's questions 2 and 3.

Devlin

Thanks for the note. Very useful. A few questions for clarification:

1. Can the Directive do nothing about legal unbundling? As I understand it 
this involves no change in ownership but just a requirement
that the owners of Company X spin off their network operations into a 
different company - which they would still own.

2. It seems that your statement that ""only States can be addressed"" opens up 
the possibility that States could, following an  86-based Directive, undertake
a range of actions - including forcing a more level playing field by 
requiring more unbundling and regulated TPA. Is this correct?

3.What specific actions might be undertaken by the Commission as part of 
86-based
Directive?


Thanks, Paul

Subject: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3) Directive

This e-mail is for background information so that we can have a clear view on 
the prospects and content of  an eventual Art 86(3) Directive.  

The current European Commission's Directive is based on Art. 95 of the 
Amsterdam Treaty; this is an harmonisation Directive, which means that it can 
address any issue likely to impede cross-border flows of goods and services, 
and can have positive effects (such as requirements to set up a regulator).  
An Art 86(3) Directive, on the other hand, can only address concerns within 
the context of Art 86: Art 86 stipulates that member States of the EU shall 
not favour government owned entities or other entities, to whom public 
service obligations (PSO) have been assigned, unless such favour is necesary 
for that entity to carry out it's P.S.O..  Art 86(3) Directives are 
prohibitive and preventative, rather than prescriptive.

In short, Art. 86 means that the competition rules apply to EdF, and if the 
member state won't enforce a level field, the Commission will.

In procedural terms, Art. 86(3) Directives do not have to be passed by the 
Council (member states) nor by the Parliament, though in practice the 
Commission does not act unilaterally and seeks tacit cover. Thus, in the 
Telecomms sector, when the member States found it too hard politically to 
liberalise, they engineered an impasse in Council and invited sotto voce the 
Commission to force them to do it. In effect, the Stockholm Council's 
Conclusions are a similar coded request (the reference to competition rules 
would include Art. 86). Once before the College of the Commission, an Art 
86(3) directive has to be agreed by simple a majority vote of all 
Commissioners (even if they are absent, so you need 11 positive votes). It 
cannot be blocked by a single Commissioner. Even if France/Germany combine, 
there would be 16 positive votes and four against.

What can an Art 86(3) Directive do?

-- Enforce accounts and management unbundling (not legal unbundling as that 
entails change of ownership).
-- Abolish any exclusive rights that have an anti-competitive effect (such as 
exclusive use of infrastructure, rights to import/export, interconnector 
rights?).
-- Broadly speaking, force liberalisation in a utilities sector.

What an Art 86(3) Directive cannot do?

-- Force any legal person to do anything (companies, individuals etc). Only 
States can be addressed.
-- Address positive regulatory issues (set tariffs, create regulators, 
capacity upgrades, etc).

In Summary: An Art 86(3) directive would be different from the directive 
already on the table; it would be more focussed and less general and would 
provide remedies for identified anti-competitive activities.  

Action:  We should be in a position to place before the Commission an array 
of anti-competitive actions that can be remedied by an Art. 86(3) Directive, 
especially with regard to exclusive rights..

cataract (KAT-uh-rakt) noun

   1. A large or high waterfall.

   2. A great downpour; a deluge.

   3. Opacity of the lens or capsule of the eye, causing impairment of
      vision or blindness.

[Middle English cataracte, from Old French, from Latin cataracta, from Greek
katarraktes, kataraktes, probably from katarassein, to dash down : kat-,
kata-, cata- + arassein, to strike.]

   ""The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep
   No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
   I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
   The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep.""
   William Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
   Early Childhood.

Have you seen the poem about a little girl who, with a lantern in her hands,
goes out in a snowstorm to light the path of her mother coming back from
town? Later, her parents go out to look for her, following her footprints in
the snow when we discover, ""And further there were none!"" My heart skipped a
beat when I came across those five words. I'm talking about Lucy Gray, a poem
by William Wordsworth ( http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww158.html ), that I read
in my early school days. Later, the emphasis on math and science, and
subsequent studies of computer science in college and grad school, blotted
out the world of poetry. I forgot the name of the poet and other details of
the poem but it has been haunting me ever since. Recently, while researching
some words, I came across the poem again and realized it had never really
left me. Does a poem ever do?

What is it in poetry that moves us so much? Perhaps it is a reminder that no
matter how tough, and worldly-wise we may or try to be, deep inside all of us
have the heart of a child. In this week's AWAD, I'll present words from some
of my favorite poets. Why don't you email me (anu@wordsmith.org ) about your
favorite poets and their poems?                                        -Anu

............................................................................
The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of
civilization. -Sigmund Freud, neurologist, founder of psychoanalysis
(1856-1939)

AFAC - Thank you for your response.  It is difficult for me when I do not hear
from you since I am not in Sao Paulo but I understand that you were engaged in
other Enron matters.  I am looking forward to your response since the trading
issues are not going away (the issues seem to only multiply).  Once ""the Enron
group"" has had an opportunity to review, we would like to schedule another
meeting with you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.  I look forward to receiving the 
memo
and chart.  Thank you and regards.  Sara

P.S.  Please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum.

Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into 
part time.  Nice confidentiality.  Since I have already gotten the grief, it 
would be nice to get some useful information.  What did you find out about 
part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?  My interest is for 2002.

You are all confirmed...the place is not.

Unfortunately Laurel's is too close to the real thing...it sucks!  So I canceled

I made a res at Cafe Monk on 4th between Brennan and Brannon.  Other suggestions were Thirsty Bear and Cha-Cha-Cha, both good, but greasy food.

Any oppositions to Cafe Monk, or better suggestions?  (I tried Boogaloos but they are closed Thursday)

Kurt Kaiser

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Kurt Kaiser"

Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term 
shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 
under this year
and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for 
were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings 
based on where
the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next 
summer to be trading over $4.55

Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.

Register now for EEI's Workshop Series on Electricity Markets:  How Do They 
Work?  The first workshop is April 26th.  So don't delay.

Our unique set of workshops, over four one-day sessions,  present the basics 
of electricity market design in a clear, non-technical format.  The workshops 
are designed specifically for industry policymakers who could benefit from a 
clearer understanding of market design issues.

The four workshops are:
?    April 26 - Basic Economics of Electricity Markets That I Need to Know
?    May 18 - The Basics of Electricity Market Design and How to Implement It
?    May 24 - Transmission Pricing and Management
?    June 14 - Market Monitoring and Market Power

You can attend each workshop in person in Washington DC or in your office via 
live Webcast!  You will receive a CD ROM set of the workshop presentations, 
complete with digital video and slide presentations, after the series.

To register or get more information on workshop content, log on to:  
www.eei.org/edg/meet.htm or call Judy Mastin at 202/508-5402.  E-mail Judy at

    Mike - here is the spreadsheet I have used. You need to fill in the cells in yellow for starting values, the spreadsheet calculates the rest. You can also change the assumptions at the top (blue cells). Mortgage expenses are captured in line 33 but do not include taxes and insurance, just P&I. Make sure to include taxes and insurance in general annual expenses (line 47). 

    Just take a look and fill it in as well as you can and we can talk about any questions you have.

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were modestly higher overnight due to light
short covering as both markets consolidated some of this week's
losses. I would not be surprised to see the Nasdaq try and test if
not fill Wednesday's gap at 2170.58 on Thursday. Nevertheless, this
week's trendline breakout along with the downturn by momentum
indicators strongly suggests that additional weakness into early-June
appears likely. May's reaction low crossing at 2057.99 is the
Nasdaq's next target. The Sept. S&P was also higher overnight due to
short covering following Wednesday's gap down and lower close.
Wednesday's low fell short of testing May's reaction low at 1256. If
this support is broken, it would open the door for a larger-degree
decline during the first half of June. Momentum indicators are
bearish, which suggest that additional weakness is possible.
Meanwhile, the Dow closed sharply lower on Wednesday confirming the
recent breakout below this spring's uptrend line that crosses near
11,100. If the decline off last week's high continues, May's reaction
low crossing at 10,774.10 is the Dow's next target.

European markets were mixed in overnight trading as overnight gains
on Wall Street tempered some of this week's losses. The UK FTSE- 100
was down 14.20 points at 5782.70 while the German DAX-30 was up 33.83
points at 6075.05 as of 10:01 BST.

The Nikkei gapped down and closed sharply lower overnight as it broke
out below the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally crossing
at 13,363. If the decline continues, the 50% retracement level
crossing at 12,995 is the Nikkei's next target. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling that additional weakness near- term is
possible. The overnight sell off was due to continued selling
pressure of high-tech stocks. The Nikkei closed down 1.7% or 231.21
points to 13,262.14.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds opened higher overnight as they continue to drift
sideways ahead of Friday's employment report. Trade volume remains
thin as Sept. bonds found light support on expectations for
additional weakness in the equity markets on Thursday. Momentum
indicators are turning neutral warning traders to use caution as a
short-term low may be in or near. If the decline off last week's high
resumes, May's reaction low crossing at 98-06 is Sept.'s next target.

The German bond market or Bunds continue to suffer from the euro's
fall to its lowest level against the US Dollar in six months. The
June Bunds were last down 0.24 at 105.83.

Japanese government bond markets were higher overnight due to
weakness in the Nikkei. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at
140.59 yen, up 0.40 while the yield on the benchmark No. 231 June
10-year cash bond stood at 1.240%, down 0.040 as of 1515 JT.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower in overnight trading as worries
about refiner's ability to meet summer driving demand continue to
abate. This week's API inventory data review is as follows. Crude oil
stocks fell sharply last week by 3.976 million barrels while unleaded
gasoline stocks rose by 1.611 million barrels last week. Distillate
stocks including heating oil rose by 1.919 million barrels. Refinery
capacity was up 1.00 percentage point of capacity at 95.3%.

July crude oil was lower overnight as it extended Wednesday's decline
due to spillover weakness from unleaded gas. Closes below last week's
low at 28.10 would confirm the recent breakout below this spring's
uptrend line. If the breakout is confirmed, the late-April reaction
low crossing at 27.25 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible.

July heating oil was lower overnight and is below this spring's
uptrend line crossing near 77.60. Multiple closes below this uptrend
line are needed to confirm a top and trend change has taken place.
Spillover selling from unleaded gas continues to pull the rest of the
complex lower. If a trendline breakout is confirmed, May's reaction
low crossing at 74.55 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.

July unleaded gas was sharply lower for the fifth day in a row in
overnight trading as spread unwinding continues and concerns over
summer gasoline supplies ease. Overnight losses led to a breakout
below the March/May uptrend line crossing near 93.25. Multiple closes
below this support level would open the door for a test of May's
reaction low crossing at 91.20 later this spring. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling that additional weakness into early-June is
possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight despite Wednesday's
upside reversal, which was due to short covering following this
week's spike below last October's low crossing at 3.86. Multiple
closes below this support level would opened the door for a possible
test of fib support crossing at 3.64 later this spring. The daily ADX
(a trend-following indicator) remains in a bearish modes signaling
that additional weakness near-term is possible. However, momentum
indicators have become extremely oversold warning bears to use
caution as a corrective bounce is possible.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro posted a new low for the year overnight and has
broken out below last November's low crossing at 85.00. If the
decline continues, a test of last October's lows crossing at 83.77 is
possible later this spring. The daily ADX (a trend-following
indicator) is bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible into early-June are possible.

The September British Pound opened sharply lower overnight due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its gains off last
week's low. Nevertheless, momentum indicators are turning neutral to
bullish, which suggests that a short-term low might be in place. I am
looking for sideways trading to continue into the early-part of June.

The September Swiss Franc opened to new contract lows in overnight
trading signaling that this year's decline is resuming. A lower close
during the day session would confirm the recent breakout below last
October's low crossing at .5643 while opening the door for a possible
test of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this year. The ADX (a
trend-following indicator) has entered a bearish trend mode signaling
that sideways to lower prices into June are possible.

The September Canadian Dollar was lower overnight following
Wednesday's key reversal down. The stage is set for a test of this
spring's uptrend line crossing near .6440. Multiple closes below this
support level would confirm a trend change has taken place while
opening the door for sideways to lower prices during the first half
of June. Momentum indicators are bearish warning traders that
additional weakness is possible.

The September Japanese Yen was lower in narrow trading overnight as
it continues to consolidate below trading range resistance that
crosses at .8425. Stochastics and RSI remain bullish but are nearing
their respective overbought zones signaling that time might be
running out for bulls. Closes above.8483 are needed to confirm an
upside breakout of this spring's trading range.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was lower overnight but is working on a possible
inside day following Wednesday's sharp loss and spike below April's
uptrend line crossing near 267.50. Multiple closes below the uptrend
line would confirm a breakout while opening the door for a test of
this spring's low crossing at 257.30 later this year. Stochastics and
RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness into June is
likely.

July silver was steady overnight as it is working on a possible
inside day to consolidate some of Wednesday's sharp losses. However,
Momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional
weakness near-term is possible. If the decline off last week's high
continues, a test of trading range support crossing at 4.31 is July's
next target later this year.

July copper was lower overnight as it continues this week's sharp
decline. July's inability to post a short covering bounce on
Wednesday underscores the weak tone of the market as the door is open
for additional weakness and a possible test of May's low at 74.75
later this spring. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices into early-June appears likely.

GRAINS

July corn was fractionally higher overnight as traders await this
morning's export sales report. Pre-report estimates range from
700,000 to 950,000 metric tonnes. While this week's export inspection
report on Tuesday was higher than the previous week, it was still
well below the pace needed to meet the latest USDA export projection.
Traders are expecting to see the USDA to lower their export
projection for this year in the upcoming June supply/demand report.
Any further cuts in export demand will only add to the bearish
carryout level, which is currently projected at 1.989 billion bushels
by this fall. Cool/wet weather across the western Corn Belt continues
to slow early crop development however, the latest planting progress
report shows that 95% of the crop has been planted making this a
non-issue. The recent breakout below weekly support crossing at 1.91
1/2 has opened the door for a possible test of last summer's low
crossing at 1.74 1/2 later this year. Early calls are for July corn
to open steady to a 1/4 cent higher this morning.

July wheat was fractionally higher in overnight trading following
Wednesday's downside reversal. Light support came from light position
squaring ahead of the release of this morning's export sales report
and news that Japan bought 100,000 metric tonnes of July wheat.
Pre-report sales estimates range from 200,000 to 400,000 metric
tonnes. It will take multiple closes above broken support crossing at
2.65 to temper the near term bearish outlook in July wheat. Until
then, the door remains open for a test of weekly gap support crossing
at 2.56 then the long-term pivot level at 2.50 later this spring.
Early calls are for July wheat to open steady to 3/4 of a cent higher
this morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were fractionally higher in overnight trading due to
short covering as it consolidated some of this week's losses. This
week's trendline breakout confirmed that a double top was posted with
last Friday's high. The latest planting progress report came in above
the five-year average, which eased planting concerns. Demand remains
strong, which should force the USDA to raise this years export
projection in the June supply/demand report. However,
increased-planted acreage in the US along with a lack of threatening
weather continues to offset the strong demand outlook. Pre-report
sales estimates range from 150,000 to 250,000 metric tonnes. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into
early-June appear likely. Early calls are for July soybeans to open
steady to a 1/2 cent higher this morning.

July soybean meal was higher overnight due to short covering
following this week's trendline breakout. While domestic and foreign
demand remain strong, this week's break in soybeans brought some
reality back to the market that there are still plenty of soybeans
around. A short covering bounce on Thursday is possible if today's
export sales report comes in at or above expectations. Pre-report
estimates range from 75,000 to 150,000 metric tonnes. Momentum
indicators are turning bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices into early-June appear likely. Early calls are for July
soybean meal to open 20 to 30-cents higher this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August lean hogs closed up $1.65 at $63.35. Prices closed near the
session high. The strong rebound continued, after limit-up gains seen
Tuesday. The market just got too extended on the downside, especially
in the wake Friday's bullish USDA Hogs & Pigs report. Fund buying was
featured Wednesday, sources said. Prices broke out above and negated
a steep five-week-old downtrend. The bulls now have the near-term
edge. However, I would not be surprised to see some sideways
consolidation in the coming sessions. Next resistance lies at $64.00.
First support is located at the 62.00 level.

August live cattle closed off $0.45 at $73.70. Speculative traders
took profits after the recent big runup had pushed the market into
oversold territory. I would not be surprised to see more of a
downside correction soon. Prices pushed to a fresh four-month high
Tuesday. Resistance lies at the $74.50 level. First support lies at
the $73.40 level.

SOFTS

July N.Y. sugar closed 15 points lower at 8.59 cents today. Prices
today dropped to another fresh four-week low as the recent higher
volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish. Also, the rare
and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play out on the
daily bar chart. Bears have the technical edge at present. However,
the market is overdone on the downside at present, on a technical
basis. Next support comes in at 8.40 cents. First resistance is now
seen at 7.72 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 65 points lower at 59.15 cents. Prices came
within 10 points of the contract low set in April. Bears rule. Bulls
can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price level,
which would signal a big double-bottom reversal. Still, given the
upcoming frost season in South America, I suspect the downside from
present levels will be limited in the coffee market. Speculative
short-players won't want to get too brave at this time of year. First
support comes in at the contract low of 58.80 cents. First resistance
is now seen at 63.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $39 lower today, at $964. More technical
damage was inflicted by the bears as prices hit another fresh
three-week low, as there was follow-through selling from Friday's
gap-lower trade. The bears are in control, but the market is
short-term overdone on the downside at present. Next support comes in
at $955. First resistance is now seen at $1,009.

July cotton closed 32 points lower at 40.72 cents. Prices hit a fresh
contract low just yesterday, in the wake of a bearish USDA cotton
consumption report last Friday. Cotton is in a strong bear market and
any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the bears--for now.
Next support lies at 39.95 cents--the contract low. First resistance
is seen around 42.00 cents.

Dear Andrew:

Now you can learn the most powerful, valuable and profitable
trading method EVER!

. . . Now Revealed In NEW Trading Course
For Just A Small, No-Risk Investment

World Famous ""Turtle"" Commodity Trading Method
. . . Now Available To You

On Video And In Clear Trading Lessons
In The Privacy Of Your Home
. . . At A VERY Affordable Low, Low Price!!

Fifteen years ago, one futures trader stunned the entire trading
world as he methodically turned $400 into over $200,000,000
trading futures. In 1983, he personally taught his trading
strategies and systems to 14 people he nicknamed ""The Turtles.""

In the next five years, the Turtles earned some $35,000,000 as
their percent of profits from the $175,000,000 profit they made
for their teacher (who bankrolled their trading)!

Yes, those zeroes are correct.

As a group, the ""Turtles"" have been trading now for over 14 years
and currently manage $2,000,000,000 (2 BILLION dollars) given to
them from people and institutions all over the world. Estimated
profits for the 16 months ending this past April are over
$300,000,000 (that's 300 million dollars actual, documented
profits!)

Even now - 14 years later - five of the world's top 10 futures
money managers are Turtle traders!

Now You Can Learn The ""Turtle"" Trading System And Strategy
In An Exciting Personal Trading Course - In Your Living Room

of what I might contribute to an organization.  I would appreciate an

Hi Vince,
?
I'm sorry you weren't around in Sydney this week.  You missed a very good 
book launch party that John Martin organised here for us.  Paul made a short 
speech in which he relayed some great comments which he said  came from?you - 
thanks very much!
?
Please find attached the next EPRM article. Its not  really tided up fully 
from our end yet, but I wanted to send it off before the  weekend in case you 
got chance to look at it. Because of the Easter break Robin  is after it by 
Thursday of next week.
?
Best regards.

Chris.

Edmund changed the contract description.
LME + COMEX are fine with Enron using their names + prices.

Jeff,

The subtrans rate has no distribuiton in it (by definition) and T is small so 
that rate is essentially the gen component for all the TOU rates.  Unless the 
CPUC has reached new hights of insanity, the gen component shoudl be about 
the same ($100/MWh) for all the retail rates shown.

Hope this is what you were after.

Alan"

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,


        H. Dale Rexrode
        Director, Producer Services
        and Business Development"

Subject: WINNING TICKET


Dear  State 
Lottery Commission,

??? I know I chose the  
winning numbers for Wednesday's Lotto drawing.? But
upon further  review, 
it appears the incorrect numbers appeared on my
ticket.
How  could this 
happen?? The root cause of this dilemma is the form I  filled
out to get 
my ticket.? The form is very confusing.? I  thought I 
was
choosing
one set of numbers, (the winning numbers), when  in reality I 
chose a
completely different set of numbers.? The  numbers and boxes on 
the form are
so close together, it's impossible to  determine which box to 
fill in for
which number.
??? I  checked with at least 3,000 
other people, and they all had the exact
same  problem.? I'm sure if you 
review the form I filled out, it will  become
very clear that I'm entitled to 
the money from Wednesday's  drawing.? Please
reply with the date, time, 
and location, for me to  collect the winnings due
to me.

Thank you for your assistance in this  
matter.

Al  
Gore

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

HEREWITH A LETTER THAT KEN MIGHT WANT TO SEND TO CALLUM MCCARTHY
Dear Callum,
I much enjoyed chatting with you in Aspen: it is always a relief to meet
a regulator who tries to get the process right, and then lets the chips fall
where they may.
In its efforts to remain open to new ideas, Enron has established an
advisory council consisting of academics, business people, political gurus
and the like (Irwin Stelzer is a member). This council meets twice a year
with Enron executives. Our next meeting is scheduled for October 31 at our
London headquarters ( we have a dinner the previous evening, at which we
review the state of political play around the world; you might find it
interesting).
One of the suggestions at the Aspen meeting was that traditional
regulation of energy markets might usefully give way to, or at least learn
some lessons from, financial regulation. Since you are one of the few
regulators who has had experience both in financial markets and in utility
regulation, we are hoping that you might be willing to share some ideas with
us on this subject. A 30-minute talk followed by what I promise will be a
very lively discussion would be perfect from our point of view.
We know how pressed you are for time, but are hoping you will favor us
with your thoughts on this interesting and difficult subject.
KEN: I don't think you can offer him a fee."

Dear Members-

As you are aware, MAPP has filed with the FERC to change its Line Loading
Relief Procedure to use the NERC Transmission Loading Relief Procedure for
curtailment of Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service and Network and
Native Load obligations.  This is to become effective when automation of the
Network and Native Loads obligation calculation is implemented.  The current
schedule for implementation of this automation is now July 16, 2001.  Please
inform the appropriate individuals in your organization of this schedule.

We will continue to update the Membership as we receive information from
NERC.


Sincerely,

Bill Head
Director of Transmission Operations
MAPPCOR

Subject: Genoil addition to MPR

Shona
 We have had issues in the past with Canada not informing us of all of their 
Merchant investments.  For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally 
received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was 
placed in Raptor I).  Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about 
an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the ""hot list"" but we were 
told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the 
MPR.  Today, we were told that Kyle Kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called 
Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares).  Again, we did not know that they owned 
this investment.  We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau 
Canada is on the restricted list and think Genoil would be, too.
 A trip to Canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure 
policies regarding the MPR.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
additional information.

Toronto Stock Exchange) in addition to 7,000,000 Beau Canada Exploration 
shares.

Beau Canada owned an interest in Genoil Inc..  In August Beau announced that 
it was going to distribute its ownership in Genoil to Beau shareholders.  
Each Beau Canada shareholder received 2/3 of a Genoil share for each Beau 
share.

As discussed with you last week, Governor Pataki is holding a fundraiser for 
his reelection campaign in Houston on Monday, June 4th. (His current terrm 
expires in 2002.) According to the fundraiser organizing this event, 
Elizabeth Blakemore (713-526-3399), there will be a reception from 5-6:30 
p.m. at the home of Judy and Jack Holmes in River Oaks, followed by a dinner 
at 7 for approximately 20 people at a location to be determined. Governor 
Perry will be attending the reception, but not the dinner. All proceeds from 
the fundraiser will go to the Pataki campaign. Tickets to the dinner are 
$5,000.00 per person.

When I spoke with Blakemore last week, she indicated that the event was being 
chaired by Bill Wise from El Paso, but she was willing to figure out a way to 
get Ken or Jeff equal billing. She indicated that they do not yet have a 
location for the dinner and suggested that it might be hosted in Ken or 
Jeff's home. She also suggested that if we were willing to commit to $25,000, 
we should be given co-chair status and would check with Pataki's office to 
confirm that. I spoke with Blakemore today (5/11) and she confirmed that we 
would definitely be given co-chair status for a $25k contribution. (She noted 
that there may in fact be one or two others as well.) 

I recommend that we co-host the event. As Rick correctly noted, we don't have 
much of a relationship with Pataki, and this would give us a chance to begin 
to establish closer ties with him. As you may be aware, NY law limits 
corporate donations to NY candidates in any one year to $5,000.00 in the 
aggregate. However, every individual corporation is allowed to make a 
separate $5,000.00 contribution. 

For the time being, I asked Blakemore to use me as her contact person. But it 
makes sense to get her hooked up with someone in Houston. Let me know how you 
want to proceed."

 Kevin,   <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:of=
fice:office"" />

EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi=
nanced and sold.  All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit=
y purchaser have been dropped, and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu=
ction. =20

I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are=
.   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t=
o the deal. =20

 1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en=
ergy credits (""RECS"") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili=
ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat=
ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. =
Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry=
over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina=
lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, =
the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=
 the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  =
There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o=
f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=
 clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal

 2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro=
visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5=
.04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere=
d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=
 5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p=
ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos=
ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t=
he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would =
not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi=
th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.

 3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed =
by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=
 affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n=
ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr=
on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ=
ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain =
in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good =
as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t=
hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub=
stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w=
ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i=
s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe=
ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga=
tion unless released by the project.

Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu=
e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin=
g but ensure delay.

 From an Enron perspective:

?     The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on =
the Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surro=
unding the ambiguities in the PPA

?      While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (=
different offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale o=
f the Indian Mesa II project.

?     If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within=
 the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cas=
h at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease i=
n planned earnings

?    The after-tax return to Enron in a ""hold"" situation is 0%, due to Enro=
n being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax=
 benefits.

It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla=
rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20

I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.

Dear Jim:

Mr. Chike Okpara and Mr. Reginald Sewell have enthusiastically accepted our offer to work at Enron as Summer Associates/Clerks during Summer 2001.

The Term begins on or about May 14, 2001, and ends on or about August 17, 2001.  Both gentlemen indicated that they might need a few days after school ends on May 11, 2001 and begins again on August 20, 2001.  We indicated that we have some flexibility with respect to the start date and we are waiting to receive information from Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell with respect to the dates.

As per our initial discussions, it is my understanding that Enron would like the students to rotate through Enron Broadband Services, Enron Energy Services, and Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want me to include Enron Global Finance, Enron Transportation Services and Enron Corp. in their rotations?

Depending upon the number of Enron entities participating in the rotations, each student will spend approximately 2-3 weeks in each business unit, if there are five business units.  In the event we only have three business units, each student will spend approximately 4 weeks in each area. 

I will make sure that Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell receive a personal introduction to Enron via our orientation process.  Further, I will participate on a weekly basis as a mentor and liaison with each student.  In addition, should we need assignments from Corporate Legal, I will be happy to coordinate the same.

During our program, I envision their duties as follows:

	1.  Provide legal research assistance, including the preparation of legal memorandum and other documents, 
	on various issues;

	2.  Attend meetings and conference calls as required by their respective assignments; and 

	3.  Undertake other legal duties as required by the respective law departments.

I have also spoken to Lisa Falick, Attorney Recruitment Coordinator at Vinson & Elkins.  She will forward to me the Summer Associate/Clerk activities list upon its completion.  

Please advise if you would like for me to take any additional steps.  

Thank you.

Sharon"

Subject: gas prices

Vince-

1. We can detect ""hoarding"" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against 
the actual inflow.

2. We can detect ""market power"" by dissociating the seller from the buyer, 
distinguishing between the physical ""cost"" in gas to run the generators and 
the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.

3. (As you noted) We can detect ""storage"" as the difference between inflow 
and consumption.

It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model 
of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market 
prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing 
capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas 
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for 
the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors: 
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can ""calibrate"" the 
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price 
elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding, 
from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis 
trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage 
and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and 
each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally, 
flows are ""explained"" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if 
necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of 
the weather.

I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a 
model.

Clayton

Andy, Travis

Following our call last night, I attach a re-draft of the Posting Agreement, 
marked to show the changes.

Look forward to your response, in particular relating to the identification 
of the relevant Interfaces and the respective responsibilities of the parties.

Thanks

Upon further reflection I think we need to revisit the issue of specifying 
the interfaces. Given that EnronOnline will be implementing and operating 
this agreement leaving the interface specifications up in the air is asking 
for a lot of work/trouble next year. They are fairly generic and 
straightfoward and should not create a delay. They really are an integral 
partof the posting agreement. If you would like to discuss I am available 
tomorrow, give me a ring

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, 
everything should be billed through the system.

The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the 
confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to 
include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is 
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Sara and Jason:
Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather 
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could 
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Carol

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

steve and rick-
mark halperin is the political director at abc -- the smart guy sitting to
peter jennings's right all night on election night who knew everything. his
brother is a speechwriter at the nsc. you'll see below his recommendation of
mark katz and his number.

i also emailed peggy noonan to ask for any ideas. haven't heard from her
yet. she's been very busy writing some of the more brilliant commentary on
the current situation which i'm sure hasn't been allowed into the shapiro
empire.

speaking of stock prices, what the hell happened yesterday? i'm still a
stock holder (very small) so pass my bitches along to koenig.

what do you mean 'on principle'? there couldn't be a better issue for a

democrats and they just hired summer's  congressional person at treasury to
run their d.c. office. is your brother still at the nsc?

katz is the person i was thinking of. i'll pass his name along. thanks.

your level of apologizing was not necessary but after re-reading my initial
email i can see where you could be mistaken that i was upset. i'm not. i
just don't want to break one of the only flows of insider information that i
have left -- even if it's into a has-been.

but while i have you gravelling, you could do something for me. i just got a
call from my old boss at enron and he is looking to hire someone as a
consultant who specializes in humor writing. they want to try a humorous
approach in taking on the monopoly utilities in the battle over electricity
deregulation. do you know anyone in the clinton administration who has been
responsible for some of the president's humorous speeches? or anyone that
fits this bill? what about your brother? it seems like i read a profile of
one of them recently who was leaving. the only republican i can think of is
landon parvin who has been around forever.

two people here did stupid things (first me, by in a hurry giving
instructions to my colleague about what to do with the information;then my
colleague for sending it to somebody untrustworthy)

so: i apologize...being in a hurry is no excuse for being careless.....

here's the silver linings:

1. gma seems to have gotten it some other way later in the day, so from
there point of view, they aren't focused on where it came from
2. there is literally no one at abc who knows i know you
3. i give you my word that i will never be at all careless with anything
from you again, and won't let even one person have access to
emails/information from you...the person in this case doesn't know it came
from you (or jb for that matter, since i had already taken her name and your
name off of it)

again, i'm sorry.....i have zero tolerance for such carelessness, and
pleading being overwhelmed with work on the story is no excuse

ps: i hope you saw jamie's interview...it was priceless

Dear eric,




ROCKETS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE MAVS SATURDAY

After trailing the Lakers by 15 points in the third quarter of last night's game, the Rockets needed a lift. They turned to the sold-out Compaq Center crowd and got what they were looking for. 

With the house-a-rockin', Steve, Cuttino and the gang led a furious second-half Rockets rally spurred by the energy of the sold-out arena. Although the comeback fell just short, the fans' support was a certain factor in the rally.

The Rockets will be looking for the same support Saturday when Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks pay a visit to Compaq Center for a Texas Showdown. Game time is 7:30 p.m.

Tickets are going fast, so get yours today by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX, visiting any Ticketmaster outlets or the Compaq Center box office, or ordering online at rockets.com (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=133970&UID=45456540&MID=188026).

See you at Compaq Center!

All -

Attached are numerous documents related to the Weirton Steel gas deal.  I think the file QA2383_20010401_4.pdf (tabbed over below) contains the confirmation with the GTC's used to set forth credit terms.  Please call me with any questions.

Paul,

As promised last week, please find attached to this correspondence a draft term sheet which outlines six potential asset management outsourcing arrangements.  These various proposal structures signify initial steps representing general commercial concepts to be further refined by a transaction team.

I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal department.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, 

Jean

I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. =
The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the=
 unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally,=
 people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the e=
state which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to spons=
or green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the fo=
rm of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.
=20
I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as di=
fficult as this may be.
=20
The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;
=20
Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at =
least at current levels
Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a p=
erson as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typica=
lly, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr=
ent have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NE=
TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th=
e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that=
 is lost forever.
Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr=
on's current arrangement, if we perform.
Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of =
cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. =
This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com=
mitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to rep=
ay it.
Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each cas=
e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the sp=
ecific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting per=
iod but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take En=
ron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their pl=
an requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obvious=
ly will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years=
 in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contr=
asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is the=
re a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on ne=
gative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too=
 much innuendo here.
VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is a=
pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l=
ogistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these wil=
l take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who hav=
e VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will =
not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou=
nter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid travel=
ing outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be=
 legit.
Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from s=
cratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil=
l support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enro=
n estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officia=
lly proclaimed.
Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although e=
ach counter-party has indicated a desire to ""normalise"" the terms with thos=
e of their own company, over time.
Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate pla=
ns to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective bu=
yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working =
assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, w=
ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that indi=
viduals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not=
 honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions =
that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation her=
e.
=20
Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary review=
s, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out=
, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after al=
l the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks =
in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over=
 the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while=
 to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal postin=
g process).
=20
As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON""T want to go and=
 why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an ""offer"" to switch and NOT accepti=
ng it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the ""offer"" are unlikely to=
 be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch t=
hem out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance=
, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early wh=
o had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.
=20
Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points fo=
r all. Lets get them out Weds.

David,
I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zh=
iyong Wei, two senior IT guys, had concerns about Netco and were asking me =
why it wouldn't be better to stay on the Estate. My whole purpose in discus=
sing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However=
, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exager=
ration.
=20
I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the differenc=
e between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking wit=
h everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be ta=
lking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did te=
ll the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a prob=
lem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon dea=
l closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it =
would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us no=
w if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer =
same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time =
of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited informa=
tion but we would update the group when more became available.=20
=20
It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their =
visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but=
 my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have =
also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is th=
at we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until dea=
l closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital a=
nd will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole.=20
=20
In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns =
are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they fe=
el like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are =
on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process =
over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked =
to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with s=
ome options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we reque=
sted but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns.=20
=20
I will call Jay first thing Monday morning and discuss how we want to corre=
ct this miscommunication. Please keep me updated if you hear anything else.=

Subject: I am getting heat from IT.....



....Essentially I am guessing that what we asked them to communicate re NET=
CO and what they did may be two rather different things. While the 1078 mil=
es (I counted them - it broke up boredom of drive) between me picking up vo=
icemails here and what is actually transpiring, it sounds like we a mis-com=
munication mess in IT.

People are suggesting that NETCO guys were told, they had no choice but to =
go and if they didn't they would lose there visa, etc., etc.,

This was not our intention clearly. We (I thought) made it clear that we wo=
uld initially work on basis that people could choose to stay with estate bu=
t we'd like to talk with them about why. If it's VISA's we have that nailed=
, they shouldn't be concerned. If it's getting ""offered a lower paid job"" t=
hat simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay an=
d Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they=
 would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated=
 company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them=
 to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties ben=
efits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bri=
dge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (c=
urrent proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, sto=
ck awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working=
 assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherw=
ise.

On retention, we have requested a pool of retention dollars for all those p=
eople who didn't receive anything from the estate in Nov and we plan for th=
is to be paid to employees in the form of a cash ""retention/bonus"" payment =
on or as soon after deal closure as we can. As you guys know these dollars =
approximate the annual bonus numbers they might otherwise have received if =
Enron was solvent.

Help me manage this please.=20

I trust things are well in Houston.

The reason for contacting you is to inquire as to your schedule during the 
week
commencing Monday 18th September.   I and several of my colleagues would very
much like to meet up with you, however, we are tied up at a large conference
between Tuesday through to Friday of that week.

Is there any chance in meeting with you on Monday 18th?  If so, I will brief 
you
more fully on our people and will contact you to discuss an agenda.

Regards, ALLAN

clarifies the parties' original intent.   

I understand we are meeting at 9:30 a.m. this morning in Rob Kilmer's office.

Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken too has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

I'll see what else I can find out. Only thing I'd add to Chris's note is an agreement that he will move to Houston if we meet all ""reasonable"" costs.

Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the ""Crescendo entity"" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF"

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT, JOINT DEFENSE PRIVILEGE

Dear Larry and Merlin,

 This will confirm our various telephone conversations about the 
above-referenced case.  Again, it is my understanding that we have all agreed 
(me on behalf of Northern/Transwestern, Larry on behalf of Duke, and Merlin 
on behalf of CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern) to jointly retain Jim Peters to 
represent our respective interests in responding to the defendants' subpoenas 
and recently-filed motion to compel, which I have been advised is set for 
telephonic hearing on Monday, August 14, at 8:00 a.m.  Per this agreement, we 
will share Jim's fees and expenses on a 1/3 Northern/Transwestern, 1/3 Duke, 
1/3 CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern basis.  As part of this agreement, each of 
us agrees to handle substantially all of his respective client's actual 
document production in-house, in order to hold Jim's fees and expenses down.

 In the very unlikely event that Jim encounters an unanticipated conflict 
between the positions of our respective clients, you additionally agree that 
Jim may withdraw from the representation of your clients in this matter, but 
may continue to represent Northern and Transwestern in this matter.

 Jim is currently working on a draft response to defendants' motion to compel 
for Northern/Transwestern.  By copy of this, I am asking Jim to send each of 
you drafts at the same time that he sends a draft by me.

 I look forward to working with you both.

     Regards,

     Britt Davis

Same data by counterparty, also showing percentage today versus last-two-week average, is in the enclosed spreadsheet.  Most counterparties are at or near typical rate.  Many of the larger counterparties are trading at a faster pace (Aquilla, Dynegy, Reliant in particular).  AEP, Calpine, Cinergy Marketing, Sempra and Mirant are at least 50% off their typical pace, particularly AEP and Calpine.

the second half of the eSpeak session, Dr. Gilad did answer all the questions 
he received.  As always, the transcript of the discussion will be available 
in the eSpeak archives.  

If the technical issue prevented you from asking a question during today's

I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy 
counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a ""Suggestion of Bankruptcy"" 
rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  

In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the 
debtor or the debtor's property.  Joe questioned whether the stay applies to 
our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which 
excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the 
exercise of police and regulatory power.

According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of 
the stay.  He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our 
complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.  I said it could be argued 
whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal 
Power Act.  While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, 
he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the 
court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it 
violated the automatic stay.  

He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except 
the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could 
itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of 
establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call 
with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file 
this ""Suggestion of Bankruptcy.""

* Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 
of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a ""debtor in possession"" and a 
trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is 
warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.  "

> As Accusations Fly, Judge Orders Auburn Alumni Association to Hold New
> Election
> By COURTNEY LEATHERMAN <mailto:courtney.leatherman@chronicle.com>
> An election for new members of the Auburn Alumni Association's board
> turned so ugly Saturday that first the voting was postponed and then,
> after a state judge was called in, the whole thing was scrapped. The judge
> ordered the association to hold a new election in two weeks.
> Voting for a new slate of alumni leaders is traditionally a low-key
> affair, but it turned into high drama when an alternative slate of
> candidates was put forward at the last minute and at least 150 people
> showed up to vote. Beneath all the accusations -- that proxies were
> improperly collected and that fax machines were jammed to prevent opposing
> votes -- is the real issue: Next month, voters in Alabama will decide
> whether to amend the state constitution to change the way that Auburn's
> trustees are elected. If the referendum passes, as it is expected to,
> leaders of the alumni association will have a say in the selection of
> trustees.
> The amendment calls for the creation of a nominating committee consisting
> of the governor, two trustees, and two directors of the alumni
> association's board. Currently, trustees are appointed by the governor.
> On Saturday, seven nominees -- a new president, vice president, and five
> other members -- were to have been elected to the association's board. The
> slate, which was put forward in July by the association's nominating
> committee, included some people who have pushed for changes in the way
> that Auburn's trustees are elected. The proposed changes on this year's
> ballot include a measure that would establish term limits for Auburn's
> trustees and that would allow alumni who live outside of Alabama to serve
> as trustees, as well as involve alumni leaders in the selection of
> trustees. That's the legislation that will go before voters.
> Less than a week before the alumni association vote was to take place, an
> alternative slate for all the posts but president was put forward by the
> nominee for president, Golda McDaniels. Ms. McDaniels could not be reached
> for comment, but critics of the new slate believe that Ms. McDaniel was
> nervous about whether she would really be elected and sought proxy votes
> in her behalf from many alumni, including a controversial and long-time
> Auburn trustee, Robert E. Lowder.
> Mr. Lowder has opposed efforts to change the way trustees are selected,
> and his critics speculate that he saw an opening when Ms. McDaniels asked
> for his support: He planned to get her to put forward a whole new slate
> for all the other posts to be elected by proxy votes. The suggestion is
> that Mr. Lowder wanted to ""take over"" the alumni association so he and his
> allies could maintain control over the Board of Trustees.
> ""We failed to realize the steps that Mr. Lowder will go to to not allow
> any alumni involvement in the election of trustees,"" said Andy Hornsby, a
> nominee to the alumni association's board and an outspoken advocate of
> changing the trustee-selection process.
> Mr. Lowder called the charges ""ridiculous."" He said his only involvement
> was that Ms. McDaniel had asked for his proxy vote and he had agreed to
> give it. ""I was just trying to help the lady,"" he said, noting that she
> would be the first woman elected president of the alumni association. ""I
> get blamed for everything over there,"" he said. Mr. Lowder accused the
> supporters of the original slate of improperly adjourning the meeting
> because they didn't have enough proxy votes to win.
> While Auburn's homecoming game against Louisiana Tech was going on, alumni
> leaders were meeting in Lee County Circuit Court, where Judge Jake Walker
> denied Ms. McDaniel's request to reconvene the election meeting and her
> request to end the period for proxy votes. Instead, the judge told the
> alumni association to hold a new election.

Mr. Lay
Have you ever been sucker punched?  In case you haven't let me describe it to you.  First you are stunned and shocked because you didn't see it coming.  Then you realize that you can't breath because the wind has been knocked out of you.  Then you get mad when it sinks in that something like this could have happened to you.  Well Ken!  The employee's of Enron know what it is like because it just happened to us. 
     You asked one thing of the people that work for you.  To make Enron the worlds leading energy company.  We gave that to you and what did we get in return?  
     I can handle a few bad investments and a downturn in the economy affecting the price of our stock.  What I can't handle is everything else that we are reading about in the national news every day.
     Every month in our team meetings we go over Enrons vision and values and describe what each one means to us.  Little did we know that we were the only ones paying attention to what they stood for. Can you tell me what each one means to you right now.  RESPECT?    INTEGRITY?    COMMUNICATION?    EXCELLENCE?   
     I am trying to keep my head up when people ask me what happened but it is getting harder all the time.  I have stopped trying to defend you and the others that are involved.  
     I have been proud to work for this company for 21 years and now because of something out of my control it is all gone.  You made more in 1 year then I have made in my career with Enron.  You decided that you wouldn't take that 60 million dollars if  the merger with Dynegy didn't go through.  What about my 600 thousand dollars that I have saved for the last 21 years.  I have watched it's value drop to less the two thousand.  Did I have a choice?  Yes I could have sold off some of my stock, but why would I do that when Skilling was telling us it would be over 100 dollars by now.
One other feeling you will never realize is After 21 years I was standing at the end of the rainbow just to watch my pot of gold snatched away from me by the very people I trusted the most.
 
 


Johnnie

Hey Girl, 

Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well 
I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really 
meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 
11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall 
Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!"

November                             22.
?

7.

We've                             teamed  up with Toysrus.com  to offer you 
toys and savings so massive, even  our                             North Pole 
competitors are envious. 
?

6.
Create                           a Wish List      at Amazon.com and you just 
might win everything on  it--up                           to $5,000. Woo-hoo!
?
5.
By                           shopping early at  Amazon.com,  you eliminate 
stress. Carolers won't seem nearly  as                           irritating. 
?
4.
Though                           reindeer are  cute, our delivery service is 
more reliable.                           And  no fog delays.

sales clerk.

                           Free parking. 
?
1.
SHIPPING                           IS FREE on  orders of $100 or more. (Our

Louise,

I spoke to our contact at BMO and they confirmed the $11.25MM is due to us by the end of day Wed. Also mentioned they were awaiting to have off-setting discussions with John Arnold.  Let me know if I need to put another call into them Wed.

With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and ""combines"" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the ""right 
example"").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to ""junk"" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the ""market 
front-end"" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

Jim

		 Subject: Trading Edge / Bond Link Agreement

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Further to Dan's meeting with Rick late this afternoon I have amended the 
previous draft sent to Todd et al this morning .

 I have also included language to refute the claim made by Cabot that the 
facility is ""infirm""  because it is not capable of receiving at the contract 
rate  during this commissioning period. Although there is no express 
provision regarding commissioning rate in the contract , according to 
industry practice the  rate at this time may be understandably  lower but 
this does not give them the right to direct the vessel elsewhere as long as 
we are paying demurrage. TODD , I AM ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE CASE, SO PLEASE 
DELETE/MODIFY THIS PARAGRAPH IF THERE ARE RATE/ OTHER ISSUES OF WHICH I AM 
NOT AWARE.  

   Attached please find the draft which should, per Rick's instructions, be 
sent to Cabot via fax Saturday morning in accordance with the notice 
provisions of the LNG Sales Contract. I have not forwarded this revised draft 
to EdisonMission. In the mean time any further comments should be directed to 
Todd.

The Joskow/Kahn paper raises two issues:  price above cost  and witholding.  

Enron obviously has concerns with the ""price above cost"" analysis.  I drafted 
some specific concerns and put them into a draft to Enron's reponse to Hoeker 
Question 1.  Although the detail was dropped in the final draft, the basic 
technical concerns were laid out there. To really rebut Joskow/Kahn would 
take considerable work.  Jeff D's idea was to write a paper that raised 
issues and indicated how complicated a ""correct"" response would  be.

The Joskow/Kahn withholding section has recieved criticism from the ISO so I 
am not sure Enron needs to respond to that.

I think my bottom line now is that the debate at FERC will soon be over or 
enter a new stage on the 13th.  As far as how a response would help us in 
California, I think requires a discussion with Jeff.

FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, 
we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with 
Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be 
helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review 
the Hogan piece.  

Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn 
""analysis""  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be 
very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power 
included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't 
nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to 
exploring it.

Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals 
folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to 
include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull 
Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to 
have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather 
than directly from us. 

Best,
Jeff

Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California?
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isn't going far enough in its 
attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market, according to a 
paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric. The 
paper by John D. Chandley, Scott M. Harvey, and William W. Hogan argues that 
FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California 
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator, rather than 
worrying about the governance of the two institutions.
""The change in governance may help,"" says the paper - ""Electricity Market 
Reform in California"" - ""but it is not likely to be decisive in the near 
term. Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and 
trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be 
accomplished within an acceptable time frame."" Hogan, of the Kennedy School 
of Government, has been writing since 1995 in opposition to California's 
market separation.
Also, argues the paper, freeing the California utilities to engage in forward 
contracting is no panacea. ""The expectation that merely allowing utilities to 
participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high 
prices is problematic and not supported by the commission's staff report,"" 
says the analysis, adding that ""putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts 
in the present environment may make things worse."" If the underlying problem 
in California is high cost and low capacity, requiring forward contracting 
could harm not only California but also the entire Western U.S. electric 
system.
FERC's $150 so-called ""soft cap"" is a wild card that has the three economists 
scratching their heads. ""It does not appear in the staff report and there is 
little critical analysis of their implications, other than the discussion of 
Commissioner [Curt] Hebert."" If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward 
cost justification for bids above $150/MWh, then FERC is headed into an 
administrative morass ""that would rival those under wellhead price controls 
in the natural gas industry.""
If, on the other hand, the soft cap is ""truly soft"" and would only require 
some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is 
eventually deemed not just and reasonable, ""there might be little impact on 
consumer prices (particularly if the principal sources of those high prices 
are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of 
market power). Even so, the proposal might serve to deter entry and new 
investments, thus combining the worst of both worlds, high consumer prices 
and little or no new investment.""
FERC's proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just 
what constitutes market power. The paper cites the proposed order's lawyerly, 
obfuscatory conclusion that ""while this record does not support findings of 
specific exercises of market power, and while we are not able to reach 
definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers, there is clear 
evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the 
opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can 
result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the [Federal Power Act]."" The 
economists note, ""In this regard, the debate is confused because we are 
dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face.""
In the case of California, say the economists, there is no evidence of market 
power. Even the practice of generators avoiding the day-ahead market in favor 
of the real-time market ""is a response to bad market design and pricing 
incentives (including price caps), but does not demonstrate the exercise of 
market power."" Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of 
market power, they add. ""The distinction between direct marginal cost and 
opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion. Hence, a competitive 
bidder whose direct cost of generation is $40 but who could sell the same 
energy outside California for $100 should bid no less than $100. This would 
not be an exercise of market power.""

Subject: ISO ""Market Stabilization Plan"": Curtailment of firm exports

Summary:  The ISO announced today that it plans to submit a proposal to FERC 
under which it will curtail firm exports (not let suppliers send electricity 
out of California) during system shortages.  If approved, this proposal could 
have catastrophic effects on surrounding control areas because it would 
transfer California's supply problems elsewhere, primarily to the Pacific 
Northwest.  The ISO's plan to hoard electricity violates the open access 
principles of Order 888 and could possibly cause a cascade of contract 
defaults if buyers in the Pacific Northwest do not receive power and are 
forced to cover in this volatile market. 

We can wait until the ISO files this plan with FERC at the end of the month, 
or we can get ahead of this important issue and ask FERC to rule on this 
before the ISO submits its report.  A preemptive strike presumes that  we can 
overcome any procedural hurdles inherent in challenging an unfiled proposal.  
The ISO has cut some EPMI's real-time schedules over the past month or two, 
so perhaps we could get FERC to look at the curtailment issue in that context.

Tim has asked that the legal/regulatory team make this a top priority.  
Because of its importance he also wants to make sure that he and other 
traders are actively involved in preparing the FERC complaint.

Background:  Today the ISO announced the details of its ""Market Stabilization 
Plan.""  Although the plan may be DOA at FERC for several reasons, the ISO 
declared that under this plan it intends to require in-state generators to 
bid their full capacity into the proposed day-ahead market.  When questioned 
on the details of this, the ISO stated that, yes, it planned to curtail firm 
exports of energy from California during system shortages.  In other words, 
during shortages the ISO would cut the transmission schedules of in-state 
generators sending electricity out of California---even if those sales were 
""firm,"" and even if those sales were under existing long-term contracts.

The ISO argued that under its tariff it has the authority to cut schedules in 
emergency situations.  True.  But the reality is that the ""emergency"" is 
self-inflicted; by imposing price caps (another part of this Market 
Stabilization plan), the ISO is driving supply out of California.  As others 
have argued, the only ""emergency"" is price:  California has made a decision 
to keep consumer rates artificially low, and its use of price-controls has 
reduced the supply---causing a supply ""emergency""---, and the ISO now seeks 
to increase its supply by building a one-way wall around the state of 
California.  Like the roach motel, megawatts check into California, but they 
don't check out.

Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the 
Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to 
impose gas price caps.

Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most 
likely choose not to for price reasons.

Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to 
the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000.  
 
 Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 
        May  820
        Jun-Jul  980
        Aug  1050
        Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full)

During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at 
Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted ""windowing,"" lowering the 
ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they 
didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level 
(even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D).

El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times 
El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline 
outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North 
SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at 
the south system delivery point.


2.    Utilities have opposed pipeline expansions to California

Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there 
is no need for new capacity (CP99-522).

Sempra has also protested Questar's application to convert an oil line to new 
gas pipeline service to California (S. Trails Expansion).

Tony indicated to me that PGL would prefer to have his summer Harper purchases done as ENA.  The gas supply contract was set up to allow PGL to continue to purchase their own supply (for vendor diversity reasons I believe), but there is no reason ENA can't purchase this gas themselves (assuming that Tony's counterparties don't object to the change).  Tony will try to complete these transactions as ENA (or enovate, if necessary).

According to Morgan at CES, the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR.  
Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon.  You may 
already know about this deal.  Morgan handles all the nominations at East 
Ohio.

Hunter, someone on the Central desk needs to talk to Morgan about this deal.

This is slightly revised.

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4771 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 196 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

The Party date has been set...Next Wednesday at Noon we will have the German
Traditional Roof Party and you are all invited!

This party takes place when the framework for the roof is completed.  The roof
meister gives some kind of speech and we take a cut tree for him to put on top
of the roof...i think.  The only roof party that I have ever attended, the
roofer fell off the roof just as the party was to start, this roof was 3 
stories
high!  So the party never got off the ground, the emergency medical helicoptor
did eventually get the very broken but not dead roofer out of the cellar 
ground
and I never got to see what really should happen (we were just glad the roofer
wasn't dead).

HOPEFULLY, our party will be much less eventful...our house is only 2 stories
high and there is no cellar!

But at noon on Wednesday we will have beer, bratw_rst, bread, sekt and other
beverages for all to enjoy!  Hope to see as many of you as possible there, for
those unable to attend... we will send photos!

Subject:	NYISO Training

Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions."

Hi Mike,

I just wanted to follow up with you after my meeting with Larry 
Lawyer.  Larry was positive about the product and business
opportunity I developed for the broadband space.  However, 
he also feels that the general business template I presented 
can be readily covered by his current team.  

I am still open to meeting with other members of your team, 
since some of your groups may like to have some people with 
structured finance and origination capabilities work a little 
more closely with them.  I'll follow your suggestion.  Thanks
again for your time.

Mathis."

Subject: Enron's PaineWebber Service

Rocky Emery, the Dowd family, Kim Bowden, and another 15 or so employees of 
UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options, restricted stock, etc) 
left yesterday evening without any warning.  They went to 1st Union.

I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure 
they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will 
not be affected.

I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the 
affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.  Also, I'm 
going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the 
following list:  (in case this happens again, we'll have a solid back-up 
immediately)

UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider)
1st Union (where Rocky Emery went)
Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology 
standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before)
Prudential (another option with internal connections)

let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Aaron

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Kay"

Steve, Rob asked me to send the following suggested Q & A to you:

Q:  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company?

A:  Not until closing, which may not occur for several months.  Until that time the law [antitrust law] requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have in the past.  In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc.  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.

I trust this is what you needed.  If not just let me know.  Thanks."

Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly 
Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting, 
followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.

In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203 
merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be 
determined to be ""workably competitive.""  At the same time, FERC ordered a 
technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and 
urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next 
steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are 
provided below.

FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process

FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting 
requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as 
discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and 
more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over 
the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain 
entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.

According to FERC, the draft Order:

-  revises the Commission's filing requirements to reflect existing merger 
policy based on FERC's 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines;
-  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market 
analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with 
potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes 
informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses.
-  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise 
competitive concerns; and
-  reduces the industry's regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing 
requirements.

The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal 
Register.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the 
Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC 
should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also 
analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC 
should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before, 
and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did 
mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission 
assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a 
separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative 
market analysis.

Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the 
approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the 
fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated 
that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting 
the public interest by stating that the process will be ""efficient yet 
sufficient"".  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule 
addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail 
competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.

Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would 
improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the 
industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt, 
Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that 
will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants 
to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also 
stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERC's 
concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail 
competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and 
analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will 
provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into 
consideration the rapid changes in the industry.

Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was 
a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said 
that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERC's report before issuing their 
own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERC's expertise when 
reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major 
positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are 
reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the 
RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to 
preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more 
mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that 
joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be 
viewed favorably.

NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably 
Competitive

In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be 
""workably competitive.""  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical 
conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market 
participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and 
deadlines for resolution/implementation.

In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISO's September 1 and 8, 2000 
compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a 
temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISO's efforts to correct market 
flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had 
not yet satisfied the Commission's directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found 
that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the 
ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then 
gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISO's non-spinning reserve 
market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an ""imperfect 
solution,"" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the 
ISO's market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an 
opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls. 
Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack 
of the ISO's progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must 
be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.

In other action, FERC accepted NYISO's and NEPOOL's proposed Emergency Energy 
Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service 
to each other (ER00-3638-000);

Stricken items included CAE-16 (NEPOOL's 64th Agreement Amendment proposing 
the elimination of In Service and instituting new rules governing certain 
import transactions (ER00-3577-000)).

Hi, Teb:
Su's son, Bill, sent this to me. Thought you'd appreciate it. Good to talk
with you today. My schedule is so swamped with deadlines I'm feeling
overwhelmed. Had a terrific time with Su, Laura, and Mother, and wish I could
get Mother with someone else while I'm having to work. She's been reading a
lot, though, which helps. Sitting in my office now, where I have an a.c.
We're going to Peterborough Players tonight for opening night of play titled
""Fully Committed."" It's a one-person show and supposed to be hilarious. Will
be a nice diversion. Trying to get a lot accomplished beforehand, so I'd
better get back to work. Good luck with kitties. They are lucky you found
them!
Love,
Sandy

Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th.  The start date is the 27th.  Currently 
there are no bids ( Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon).  The min 
demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth.  The commodity 
is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00.

The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck.  However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.  

As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.  

Thank you.  "

Jones demands probe of state's energy buyers=20
By Amy Chance
Bee Political Editor
(Published July 17, 2001)=20
Secretary of State Bill Jones on Monday asked the state attorney general an=
d=20
the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate whether energy=20
consultants hired by the Davis administration violated state=20
conflict-of-interest law by holding stock in energy generators and utilitie=
s=20
while buying electricity for the state.=20
Jones said recent reports that show several energy buyers held such stock,=
=20
coupled with the fact that they failed to file reports of their financial=
=20
holdings until last week, suggest that Gov. Gray Davis ""hired them without=
=20
any forethought and due diligence as to how they could personally and=20
financially benefit from being on the state payroll.""=20
""This is either a miserable failure in executive management and leadership,=
=20
or he and his administration have colluded in a blatant and possibly crimin=
al=20
conflict of interest,"" said Jones, a Republican seeking to challenge Davis =
in=20
next year's governor's race.=20
In particular, Jones pointed to a report filed by Vikram Budhraja, a=20
consultant in the Department of Water Resources' energy resources schedulin=
g=20
division, who signed a $6.2 million, 23-month contract with the state.=20
Budhraja reported that he began working for the department on Jan. 25.=20
On Jan. 17 and 22, Budhraja acquired stock in Edison International valued a=
t=20
between $10,001 and $100,000. He also bought stock in Dynegy, an energy=20
generator, in the same value range. He disposed of all the stock on Jan. 29=
,=20
noting on the form that he ""divested holdings upon first opportunity after=
=20
start of services.""=20
He also reported that he had received income of more than $100,000 from=20
Edison International as ""a retainer to provide consulting services upon=20
request."" He noted that there was ""none requested since the third quarter o=
f=20
2000.""=20
Jones said the contract Budhraja signed with the state, however, was dated=
=20
Jan. 17, showing that he ""entered into a $6.2 million contract with the sta=
te=20
and the same day that Davis ordered a state of emergency and put the state=
=20
into the power-buying business. Mr. Budhraja sold this stock within days an=
d=20
pocketed a significant profit.""=20
Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said the contract was simply dated Jan. 17=
=20
""for administrative payroll purposes."" He said Budhraja met with Davis on=
=20
Jan. 25 and began work for the state on Jan. 29.=20
""Any activity he had with Edison International was over and done with the=
=20
minute he started his job,"" Maviglio said. ""He said he called his broker an=
d=20
said, 'Sell everything.' ""=20
Budhraja also has a letter on file with the department that says he will do=
=20
no business with Edison while employed by the state, Maviglio said.=20
While he did participate in negotiating contracts with Dynegy, Maviglio sai=
d=20
he did so ""weeks and months after he had sold his stock.""=20
Administration lawyers are still looking at reports filed last week by othe=
r=20
energy schedulers and traders that show they still hold stock with energy=
=20
generators, particularly Calpine Corp.=20
The lawyers are examining whether those consultants buy electricity as part=
=20
of their jobs and whether they have done any trading with Calpine.=20
""They may be in violation, for all we know,"" Maviglio said.=20
Representatives of the FPPC and attorney general said they are reviewing=20

Energy Digest: PG&E's managers will get bonuses


(Published July 17, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- A bankruptcy judge has approved executive bonuses at Pacif=
ic=20
Gas and Electric Co., saying the 223 managers who will divide the $17.5=20
million pool are not responsible for California's energy woes.=20
For 23 of the senior executives, the plan provides bonuses equal to their=
=20
base pay or, in the case of PG&E President and CEO Gordon Smith, $630,000.=
=20
The bonuses for other managers will average $60,000.=20
PG&E, in proposing the payments, said it was worried that senior employees=
=20
would flee to more secure and lucrative jobs, which could hamper the=20
utility's bankruptcy reorganization. Some consumer advocates opposed it,=20
saying the utility's customers ultimately would pay for it.=20
But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said he had been assured that no=
=20
effort would be made to cover the cost with future rate increases.=20
In his opinion, Montali said the bonus program was needed to prevent=20
resignations that could damage PG&E, making it harder for creditors to=20

Churches Help Edison Aid the Poor
Energy: With an assist from the pulpit, a program to provide discounted=20
electricity to those in need flourishes.
WILLIAM LOBDELL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 17 2001

Southern California Edison has enlisted the help of an unlikely=20
ally--churches--to sign up thousands of low-income customers for hefty=20
discounts on rising utility bills.

In just a few months, pastors, priests and church volunteers have become=20
Edison's most effective tool in telling the poor about a state-mandated=20
program that offers 20% off electric bills and exemptions from skyrocketing=
=20
rate increases.

Refugio Gomez, 62, a part-time janitor, signed up for the program last mont=
h=20
at Our Lady of Victory in Compton, the church where he works. Since then, h=
is=20
monthly electric bill has been cut from $48 to $18. ""I hadn't heard about t=
he=20
program before,"" Gomez said. ""[Church volunteers] helped me with the forms.=
""

The pioneer faith-based program began with 22 Orange County Catholic church=
es=20
in April and now is being rolled out throughout Southern California. Edison=
=20
employees will be at five churches in the South Bay this weekend.

The utility is concentrating its efforts initially in Catholic and=20
African-American churches, primarily because of their large congregations=
=20
and, in the case of the Catholics, their large-scale organizations. But=20
Edison officials say they plan to use a wide range of religious=20
organizations, including synagogues, mosques and temples, before the campai=
gn=20
ends in the fall.

""It's a really fantastic way to get the word out,"" said Pastor Steve Overto=
n,=20
who had Edison workers hand out information Sunday at his Christian Chapel=
=20
Foursquare Church in Moreno Valley. ""The church is called to help the poor.=
=20
We're doing what the Lord wants us to do.""

Church leaders say they are aware that their endorsement of an Edison progr=
am=20
can produce a halo effect for the besieged company. But getting lower=20
electric rates for their low-income congregants overrides those concerns.

""We're not doing this to help Southern California Edison,"" said Jaime Soto,=
=20
auxiliary bishop for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. ""We're doing thi=
s=20
to help our parishioners.""

About 62% of an estimated 1 million eligible customers participate in the=
=20
discount program started by the state Public Utilities Commission in 1989,=
=20
Edison officials said. A family of four must earn less than $31,100 a year =
to=20
be eligible for the program, which is also offered by the Southern Californ=
ia=20
Gas Co.

Religious institutions based in low-income areas have been able to knock do=
wn=20
barriers that have hindered Edison's past efforts to reach out to the poor:=
=20
suspicion from recent immigrants, language and cultural differences, and=20
ineffective marketing campaigns.

When the energy crisis began, Frank Quevedo, an Edison vice president,=20
decided religious organizations offered the best chance to reach customers=
=20
who would suffer the most from rising electric bills.

He met with Soto, who provided demographic information from the diocese's 5=
6=20
parishes.

""He knew the [community] in a way we couldn't,"" Quevedo said. ""He knew whic=
h=20
churches had the most seniors, low-income parishioners, limited-English=20
speakers. We had great results.""

Energy Crisis Prompts Change in Church Policy

The Catholic church sometimes allows other information to be distributed at=
=20
Mass, but it usually revolves around health programs, immigration issues an=
d=20
education on voter registration.

""We generally do not do business with business,"" Soto said. ""But the extent=
=20
of the energy crisis and its impact on the poor made me rethink that policy=
.=20
I've been pleasantly surprised at how many people we've reached.""

A priest's endorsement of Edison's discount program, plus church volunteers=
=20
helping fellow congregants fill out Edison forms, has proven far more=20
effective than inserting fliers in monthly bills or trying to engage shoppe=
rs=20
outside retail malls.

In Orange County, more than 1,000 church-going customers took advantage of=
=20
the discount in a single day. At Compton's Our Lady of Victory, more than 2=
00=20
congregants joined the program. Edison also had handed out 80,000 sign-up=
=20
forms that parishioners have taken home.

At a booth in a Los Angeles shopping center, Edison workers earlier this=20
month signed up only two dozen customers in a half-day of work.

Edison workers volunteer time on Sundays to pass out information at churche=
s.=20
More than 100 employees turned out on a single Sunday in April to volunteer=
=20
at nearly two dozen sites in Orange County.

""It's really a humbling experience for us,"" said Rocio Contreras, a board=
=20
member of the company's Latino employees association. ""What was really neat=
=20
was to have the priests and fathers there, letting the parishioners know wh=
o=20
we are and why we were there. That made a difference.""

Churches are a natural go-between wary immigrants and large institutions th=
at=20
provide relief services, said John Wilcox, chair of religious studies and=
=20
director for the Center for Professional Ethics at Manhattan College in=20
Riverdale, N.Y.

""It's really using churches in an area where they're already very effective=

he said. ""My only concern would be that the church needs to be an honest=20
broker. The church probably has the greatest amount of trust among the poor=

Davis, Legislature ruin two electrical companies and try to cover it up

GLEN EVANS Mr. Evans, who lives in Lake Forest, is an employee of Southern=
=20
California Edison and invests in its stock.
Billy throws a ball through Mrs. Smith's window. But when she comes out, he=
=20
blames it on Bobby, the neighborhood bully. Mrs. Smith believes Billy becau=
se=20
he seems nice, and, well, nobody likes Bobby.=20
If you knew you could get away with blaming someone else for your own=20
mistake, would you do it? That's exactly what the California Legislature an=
d=20
Gov. Gray Davis have done.
Polls say most people believe SCE and PG&E are responsible for California's=
=20
energy crisis. Truth is, our politicians bear full responsibility. No one,=
=20
except those very politicians, claims otherwise. I challenge Gray Davis and=
=20
the California Legislature to find one reputable expert in any relevant fie=
ld=20
who doesn't agree on a simple fact: If retail prices for electricity had=20
followed the wholesale cost, none of the problems we now have would have=20
happened.
Moreover, If SCE and PG&E had been treated fairly, they would have been sav=
ed=20
from financial ruin. Davis and the Legislature have many folks believing=20
these utilities were somehow responsible for the law which forced them to=
=20
sell power, their only product, for less than cost. But public gullibility=
=20
does not justify public servants lying, just like Billy, and blaming somebo=
dy=20
else to save themselves.
Rather than simply admit their mistake, Davis and the Legislature were=20
willing to let two reputable, century-old utilities go $15 billion in debt =
-=20
obligated to deliver power, but allowed to recover only a tiny fraction of=
=20
the cost. They knew it was dishonest, but the alternative - asking the publ=
ic=20
to simply pay for the electricity they used - was too dangerous politically=
.
When SCE and PG&E attempted to defend themselves, our politicians made it=
=20
known that the utilities had ""funneled cash"" to their parent companies,=20
rather than use it to pay down their debt. Truth is, the amount of money wa=
s=20
insignificant compared to the utilities' debts and it would have been just=
=20
plain stupid for a company to take its last bit of cash and throw it after=
=20
all the rest so blatantly ""appropriated"" by the state.
This transaction was common knowledge within the Legislature, having been=
=20
arranged and approved by members, and its own audit acknowledged the money=
=20
was handled properly. Many people expressed shock at this ""news'' and vowed=
=20
there would now be no ""bailout"" of these utilities.
But then came the state's own crisis - the utilities' debt was so massive=
=20
nobody would lend them any more money. The state was forced to step in to=
=20
keep the lights on, and everything changed.
Within weeks the state found out just how enormous the expense was they had=
=20
been forcing the utilities to bear. The Public Utilities Commission voted t=
o=20
raise rates and, reluctantly, Davis acknowledged that an increase might be=
=20
necessary after all.
Now came perhaps the cleverest deception. The rate increase had nothing to =
do=20
with the utilities. All of the money from the increase went straight to the=
=20
state to pay its bills. Even knowing they caused the utilities' debt, and=
=20
could fix it, they wouldn't even share this increase. But because the=20
increase would show up on the utility bill, everyone would naturally assume=
=20
it was the utilities who were now raking in even more money. So with a simp=
le=20
lie of omission - just don't say anything - nobody would ever know every=20
penny of that rate increase went straight to pay the state's debt. Not one=
=20
cent went to the utilities, still strapped with huge debts and one, PG&E, n=
ow=20
driven into bankruptcy.
Finally, a personal response to another common accusation - that SCE and PG=
&E=20
somehow took all the money out before they went into debt and the=20
stockholders got it all. I'm an SCE employee. I've worked in field service=
=20
for Edison for more than half my life.
I've had such confidence in my company and it's management that I considere=
d=20
their stock the best retirement investment I could make. So for 26 years I'=
ve=20
had money deducted from every paycheck to purchase stock. It was meant to=

guarantee my retirement security.
I had hoped I would actually be retired by now, and with the stress this=20
situation has put on we employees, I truly wish I could. But all the money =
we=20
stockholders are supposed to have is just another lie. I have lost more tha=

From the Sierra Nevada to Ventura beaches, San Francisco Bay to the Salton=

In the San Joaquin Valley, so little progress has been made recently that t=

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is poised to declare the=20
25,000-square-mile area a ""severe"" smog zone, a status shared by only 10=20
other U.S. regions.=20
Cities such as Bakersfield and Fresno are beginning to challenge the Los=20

for the nation's air pollution crown. Sequoia National Park, which is=20

more days of unhealthy ozone were recorded there last year than in Los=20

The San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Management District blames the Bay Area=

for much of its pollution, but the EPA says the smog increasingly is=20
home-grown. Local air quality officials have blocked control measures adopt=

elsewhere, insisting that they meet a cost-effectiveness yardstick more=20
restrictive than used in Los Angeles or San Francisco. The EPA directed the=
=20
district last year to implement at least six rules regulating emissions fro=
m=20
paints, solvents and oil tanks that had been set aside, but some have still=

To meet the standards, which are set at the levels required to prevent dama=

al=20
300 tons daily--equivalent to removing nearly one-third of all the cars,=20
factories and oil operations in the valley. Instead, the EPA is leaning=20
toward putting off compliance until 2007, although officials acknowledge sm=

""It doesn't look good. There's a lot that still needs to be done, and you=

environmental scientist at the EPA.=20
The Bay Area also has trouble.=20
After years of effort, the region in 1995 reached the health-based standard=

Windblown dust is the dominant source of a serious problem with particulate=

The region, which suffers some of the worst dust storms in the nation, had=

""They didn't keep up the emphasis on dust controls they had in the past,""=

Kelly said. ""They need to redouble their efforts to get back into attainmen=

Even in Southern California , which has had the best record in the country=

for smog reduction, high levels of carbon monoxide--a poison gas emitted=20

=20
The pollutant was supposed to have been eliminated last year, under=20
provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. And although regional air pollutio=

""Things are slip-sliding away,"" said Sierra Club lobbyist V. John White. ""W=

The slowdown in smog improvement ""bothers me,"" said Alan C. Lloyd, chairman=

That evaluation has begun as air quality officials develop comprehensive ne=

California continues to have a better record on smog cleanup than any other=

Secretary of State Bill Jones on Monday urged California 's attorney genera=
l=20
to investigate possible conflict of interest violations by consultants hire=
d=20
to help the Davis administration navigate the energy crisis.=20
Jones, a Republican candidate for governor, said at a Los Angeles news=20
conference that Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the state Fair Political=20
Practices Commission should determine whether seven of the consultants have=
=20
conflicts of interest because they own stock in one or more energy companie=
s.=20
He also asked the state's chief law enforcement officer to immediately=20
determine whether the governor's office violated state law by exempting 21 =
of=20
the 45 consultants from financial disclosure requirements.=20
""I am gravely concerned that a cloud of illegality and collusion exists at=
=20
the highest level of our state government due to the actions and the=20
conscious policy of secrecy of Gov. Davis,"" Jones said.=20
That brought a sharp retort from the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio,=
=20
who attacked Jones for engaging in campaign politics.=20
""The secretary of state has a five-person team bankrolled by the taxpayers=
=20
attempting to dig up dirt for political reasons,"" Maviglio charged.=20
""This is politics pure and simple being played by a candidate desperate to=
=20
get his name in the paper,"" Maviglio said. If there are any violations of t=
he=20
law, he added, ""they're going to be addressed.""=20
The secretary of state's entry into the energy controversy poses yet anothe=
r=20
headache for Davis as he prepares to run for a second term next year.=20
Already, the GOP and some power producers have begun airing commercials=20
critical of Davis' handling of the power crunch, forcing the governor to di=
p=20
into his own campaign funds to fight back.=20
Jones, as the state's chief elections officer, contends that his concerns a=
re=20
not just political. He noted that he appoints one of the five members of th=
e=20
Fair Political Practices Commission, which enforces campaign finance and=20
conflict of interest laws.=20
Among other things, Jones questioned why Vikram Budhraja, head of the=20
Electric Power Group, a Pasadena energy consulting firm, bought stock in=20
Edison International and Dynegy Corp. in the days before he went to work fo=
r=20
the state.=20
Budhraja was hired under a $6.2-million contract between his firm and the=
=20
state Department of Water Resources that was signed on Jan. 18. Like two=20
dozens of the consultants hired by the state, he did not complete a financi=
al=20
disclosure statement until last week, more than six months after he went to=
=20
work for the department, which now buys power for the state's three largest=
=20
utilities.=20
The financial disclosure statement filed by Budhraja last Thursday shows th=
at=20
he bought between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of Dynegy stock on Jan. 11. Si=
x=20
days later, he bought between $10,000 and $100,000 of Edison stock.=20
That was the same day that Davis declared a state of emergency because of t=
he=20
energy crisis and ordered the Department of Water Resources to begin buying=
=20
power on behalf of the state's financially troubled major utilities.=20
On Jan. 22, Budhraja again bought between $10,000 and $100,000 of Edison=20
stock. On his disclosure statement, he indicated that he began work for the=
=20
state Jan. 25 and sold the stock on Jan. 29--the first opportunity he had t=
o=20
divest his holdings.=20
Jones told reporters that Budhraja's investments in Edison grew by 44% to=
=20
47%, while his Dynegy investment increased 28% in that brief period.=20
Budhraja was also on retainer as a consultant to Edison International,=20
earning more than $100,000 in the year before becoming a contractor for the=
=20
state.=20
Maviglio said Budhraja wrote a letter to DWR Deputy Director Ray Hart sayin=
g=20
he had no dealings with Edison International. He also was not involved in a=
ny=20
long-term contracting with Edison.=20
Any profits Budhraja made from the stock are irrelevant because the stock w=
as=20
sold by the time he was on the job, Maviglio said.=20
Another consultant, Bernard Barretto, who describes himself as an energy=20
trader/scheduler for the state, disclosed last week that he purchased stock=
=20
in power producer Enron Corp. But no date or amount of the purchase was=20
listed.=20
Financial disclosure forms filed last week by five other consultants show=
=20
they all own stock in Calpine Corp., a major California -based power=20
wholesaler.=20
Energy trader Elaine L. Griffin bought between $10,000 and $100,000 worth o=
f=20
Calpine stock on Feb. 1. Her contract with the state began Feb. 20. Griffin=
's=20
newly completed economic disclosure statement does not show her selling the=
=20
stock. Herman Leung, who went to work as an electricity scheduler in March,=
=20
bought between $2,000 and $10,000 worth of Calpine stock on Jan. 22.=20
Schedulers William F. Mead, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie also disclose=
d=20
that they own stock in Calpine. Mead, in fact, said his holdings ranged=20
between $100,000 and $1 million. But their forms contain an important=20
omission: The consultants do not say when they purchased the shares.=20
Oscar Hidalgo, a Water Resources spokesman, said the agency's attorney is=
=20
reviewing all the past purchases to ensure that no laws were violated by=20
contractors buying power or negotiating long-term contracts with companies =
in=20
which they held stock.=20
""We're reviewing all that to see if [there were] any problems with any past=
=20
negotiations,"" Hidalgo said. ""We're looking at all the records in past buys=
=20
or trades so we understand who exactly did what.""=20
He said it's a ""very big task"" that will take weeks to complete.=20
In the meantime, those contractors who have disclosed stock ownership have=
=20
been recused from working with generators in which they have a financial=20
interest.=20
The governor's spokesman said several of the contractors who own stock in=
=20
Calpine are not traders, and thus do not have direct dealings with the=20
company.=20
""If you own Calpine stock and aren't doing any business with Calpine, then=
=20
you're fine,"" Maviglio said.=20
Calpine is one of a number of firms that negotiated long-term contracts wit=
h=20
the state and that have come under fire from critics who say they will sadd=
le=20
consumers with artificially high electricity costs for years to come.=20
For weeks, Jones has been sharply critical of the administration's failure =
to=20
require its consultants to file conflict of interest forms, which must be=
=20
completed within 30 days of a person starting work.=20
The governor's spokesman said the administration was told by the state's=20
political watchdog agency that only consultants serving in a staff capacity=
=20
or participating in decisions must file the forms.=20
As a result, he said, only two dozen of the 45 consultants were required to=
=20
complete the paperwork--most of them ""hastily and clumsily"" prepared last=
=20
week, according to the secretary of state.=20
Two of those who have not filed are Wall Street executives Joseph Fichera a=

Michael Hoffman, key advisors to Davis on his plans to rescue California 's=

debt-ridden utilities. In that role, according to their contract, they coul=

He rejected opposition from the U.S. trustee's office and the city of San=

Gov. Davis: `Not a Power Grab'

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- In a video made for a political roast, Gov. Gray Davi=
s,=20
mimicking the Mafia boss in ""The Sopranos,"" complains to his therapist abou=
t=20
Texas bad guys pushing electricity prices sky high. He vows to get tough.=
=20
Soon, a Davis confederate ushers four men in 10-gallon hats into an office,=
=20
shots ring out, and the aide, emerging blood-spattered, delivers the=20
punch-line: ""Tell the governor his Reliant problem is solved.""=20
While Gov. Davis hasn't gone that far in his fight with suppliers such as=
=20
Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., he is in other ways trying to blast his=
=20
way out of the crisis. His moves are coming in rapid succession after month=
s=20
of criticism of the governor for inaction, and they are fast reshaping the=
=20
state's electricity system.=20
With the acquiescence of other state leaders, Gov. Davis has put California=
=20
on the road to creating what amounts to a mammoth state-owned electric=20
utility, answerable largely to the governor. Moreover, though designed to=
=20
solve a short-term emergency, the governor's policies are loading consumers=
=20
with obligations that could affect the economy of the most-populous state f=
or=20
15 to 20 years.=20
His actions in some ways hark back to the system of central control that=20
preceded the disastrous 1996 foray into utility deregulation. But they aren=
't=20
simply a return to the days of monopoly utilities strictly regulated by the=
=20
state's Public Utilities Commission. What is emerging now is a California=
=20
power colossus that operates in important ways beyond the reach of regulato=
rs=20
or the public.=20
Mr. Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure supp=
ly=20
of reasonably priced electricity . ""This is not a power grab,"" the Democrat=
ic=20
governor says in an interview. ""I had no desire to intervene. I would get o=
ut=20
tomorrow if you would let me out. This is my least-favorite thing to do.""=
=20
Yet in the past six months, pushed by what he calls the ""colossal failure"" =
of=20
a deregulation plan hatched under his Republican predecessor, the governor=
=20
has put the state deep into the power business. In January, Mr. Davis order=
ed=20
the state Department of Water Resources to begin buying power in place of=
=20
California 's cash-strapped utilities. Since then, the state has purchased =
or=20
committed to purchase $45 billion to $50 billion of electricity , with some=
=20
contracts as long as 20 years.=20
The governor has in effect seized control of the state's electricity -grid=
=20
operator, the California Independent System Operator, installing his=20
hand-picked team as board members. As its name implies, the ISO was suppose=
d=20
to manage the grid without favoring any one participant.=20
Mr. Davis also is pushing to have the state buy huge chunks of the=20
transmission system that are owned by the financially beleaguered utilities=
.=20
He recently signed into law a bill that creates a state power authority,=20
whose director will be appointed by the governor. This agency, which so far=
=20
exists just on paper, could be used to build power plants and help run a=20
state-owned transmission system. Mr. Davis says that the authority is part =
of=20
what he sees as a ""hybrid"" system where public power plays an important rol=
e=20
augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business.=20
Having healthy utilities is extremely important, says the governor. He adds=
=20
that he has been working hard to revive the state's two biggest utilities,=
=20
the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison Co. subsidiary of Edison International. But as the state's role in t=
he=20
electricity business has grown, the utilities don't seem as essential as th=
ey=20
once did.=20
This is one reason the governor has had difficulty getting a rescue package=
=20
for Edison through the state legislature. The plan, among other things, cal=
ls=20
for the state to buy Edison's transmission system for $2.76 billion and=20
envisions the utility eventually resuming some power-buying chores. Talks=
=20
over a similar rescue package for Pacific Gas failed and that utility filed=
=20
for bankruptcy-law protection.=20
With the state locking up so much of the California 's future power needs,=
=20
legislators openly wonder whether utility-rescue efforts are worth the=20
billions of dollars they would require. In 2003, for instance, long-term=20
contracts will cover 90% of the state's projected buying needs. ""What does =
it=20
mean for Edison to take over the role [of buying power] if the state alread=
y=20
has signed all these contracts?"" asks State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Democrat wh=
o=20
heads the senate's energy committee.=20
Nonetheless, the governor says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" the legislatur=
e=20
soon will approve an Edison rescue package.=20
Mr. Davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricit=
y=20
mess this year, after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning=
=20
crisis. The state's utility-deregulation law, which was enacted in 1996,=20
worked fairly well until May of last year. Under the deregulation plan, the=
=20
state's investor-owned utilities sold off many of their power plants to oth=
er=20
companies and repurchased that electricity through a state-sponsored auctio=
n.=20
Consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to buy=20
electricity from nonutility retail suppliers.=20
But tight electricity supplies and a flawed auction system led to a sharp=
=20
rise in wholesale power costs. With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas and=20
Edison racked up multibillion-dollar deficits. In January, Mr. Davis declar=
ed=20
an emergency and put the state into the power-buying business.=20
Since then, he hasn't been bashful about exercising his emergency powers.=
=20
When Mr. Davis couldn't get legislative permission to borrow money short-te=
rm=20
for power purchases, he signed an executive order authorizing the state to=
=20
borrow up to $5 billion from commercial lenders. That borrowing is supposed=
=20
to be repaid from a roughly $13 billion municipal-bond issue, the biggest i=
n=20
U.S. history, scheduled for later this year.=20
In another executive order, the governor suspended emission standards for=
=20
power plants to let them run more hours during the peak-demand periods. And=
=20
the state has hired a small army of energy consultants and traders.=20
Despite such actions, some think Mr. Davis isn't being forceful enough. For=
=20
example, the state senate last week passed a resolution supporting the=20
governor's power to ""commandeer powerplants"" if he deems such a step to be=
=20
necessary. Mr. Davis has said he doesn't have any plans currently to take=
=20
such an action.=20
The electricity mess has produced ""the most extraordinary crisis of=20
governance we've had in California in the postwar period,"" says Bruce Cain,=
=20
director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of=20
California at Berkeley. Mr. Cain says more power has been placed in the=20
governor's hands and, as a result, the state has ""gotten away from the=20
separation of powers and the checks and balances that we expect in American=
=20
government.""=20
Mr. Davis says his actions have been essential and are working. He credits=
=20
the long-term power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for=20
electricity , where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply. In June, t=
he=20
state paid an average price of $167 a megawatt hour for electricity . That=
=20
was down from $243 in May, though still far above the $25-to-$27 range of t=
wo=20
years ago.=20
But some worry about how this rush to address a short-term problem will=20
affect the longer-term future. An economic forecast issued late last month=
=20
warned that continued heavy state involvement and spending in the electrici=
ty=20
business could produce enough of a drag on the California economy to reduce=
=20
state output by a total of $90 billion by 2005 and lead to higher=20
unemployment. "" California is at a crossroads"" between what amounts to a=20
""state takeover of the electricity industry"" and a more market-oriented=20
approach to fixing the problem, says the joint study by the Anderson busine=
ss=20
school at the University of California , Los Angeles, and Cambridge Energy=
=20
Research Associates.=20
Under a law enacted in February, none of the tens of billions of dollars of=
=20
state electricity purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent=
=20
by the Public Utilities Commission. That's an immunity that regulated=20
utilities in the old regime could only dream of. Then, if they spent too=20
much, the PUC could make their shareholders take a hit. Under the new syste=
m,=20
any purchasing missteps the state makes will be borne by consumers.=20
""It scares the hell out of me,"" says Henry Duque, a Republican PUC member=
=20
appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. ""The state is so busy looking after i=
ts=20
own interests . . . . Who's looking out for the ratepayer?""=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, acknowledges that the=20
commission's authority has been seriously eroded. Under the new law, the=20
commission is supposed to charge consumers for whatever sum the Water=20
Resources Department spends on energy. She hopes to hold hearings to review=
=20
the spending ""even if we can't do much about the result.""=20
Gov. Davis says concern about less oversight of power purchases is a ""bogus=
""=20
issue. ""It is not as if a private company or utility was making the=20
decisions. The PUC doesn't need to second-guess the decisions of a public=
=20
body,"" he says.=20
But other state moves suggest there's a role for oversight. The state is on=
ly=20
now doing a conflict-of-interest inquiry after several of its new energy=20
hires filled out disclosure forms that showed they held stock in big power=
=20
suppliers to the state. The governor's press secretary, Steve Maviglio, say=
s=20
he doesn't know whether they were asked about their holdings before being=
=20
hired. He says the state will take ""appropriate action"" where conflicts of=
=20
interest are found.=20
The rush to beef up an outgunned state energy team may have contributed to=
=20
the hiring problem. Early on, ""we had two or three people sitting around an=
d=20
dealing with"" big and savvy electricity suppliers, says Mr. Davis, almost=
=20
like a ""tee-ball team playing the New York Yankees.""=20
The state has since hastily assembled a group of about 20 energy traders,=
=20
headed by a 30-year-old manager with one year of experience in the energy=
=20
business. The manager, Susan Lee, has held four jobs in the past four years=
=20
and is getting paid up to $480,000 over two years for her services. Ms. Lee=
=20
declines to comment.=20
Even so, Mr. Davis argues, state negotiators did well enough. They managed =
to=20
help lower current power costs, he notes, although that required signing=20
deals that could force the state to ""pay a little more"" than it otherwise=
=20
would have in the years ahead. ""I think Californians are willing to accept=
=20
that bargain,"" he says.=20
Still, he and some other state leaders are urging the PUC to revoke a=20
fundamental tenet of deregulation: the right of consumers to shop around fo=
r=20
low-cost electricity . Removing this option is essential to prevent a ""jail=
=20
break"" of customers seeking prices lower than what the state must charge,=
=20
says Carl Wood, one of Mr. Davis's three Democratic appointees to the=20
five-member PUC. A flight of customers could leave too few to pay for=20
state-purchased power and repay the planned bonds. The PUC is scheduled to=
=20
vote in August on the request to revoke consumer choice.=20
Some users are concerned about being stuck with what amounts to a state=20
monopoly. ""We don't want to lose our options"" to shop for lower-cost=20
electricity , says Shawn Covell, a senior manager at Qualcomm Inc., the=20
telephone-equipment maker. Earlier this year, Qualcomm signed an agreement =
to=20
buy power from an alternative supplier, the kind of move state officials se=
ek=20
to ban.=20
While consumer choice is in doubt, public disclosure has already been=20
lessened in some ways. For months, the state refused to divulge terms of=20
power deals it was signing, saying that doing so would harm negotiations on=
=20
additional contracts. It finally made public the long-term contracts this=
=20
month after a lawsuit by a group of newspapers, including The Wall Street=
=20
Journal. Details of short-term power purchases were disclosed for the first=
=20
time on July 9. They showed the state spent nearly $8 billion on spot-marke=
t=20
purchases in the first five months of 2001, exceeding its projections.=20
Some Davis allies are troubled. ""Decisions are being made, with almost no=
=20
public discussion, that foreclose other options,"" says Ms. Bowen, the state=
=20
senator, who is close enough to the governor that she played his therapist =
in=20
the ""Sopranos"" skit. While Sen. Bowen says the governor needed to act=20
forcefully, she is troubled that so much power has been bought at what she=
=20
fears will prove to be extremely high prices in the years ahead. Still, she=
=20
voted for the bill that gave the executive branch carte blanche to make tho=
se=20
huge commitments.=20
The right to go to court also has been limited. Under a law soon to take=20
effect, challenges to certain aspects of the planned $13 billion bond issue=
=20
can be taken only to the state Supreme Court. That panel has accepted only=
=20
two utility-related cases over the past decade. Backers of the measure say =
it=20
gives adequate opportunity for review without unduly slowing the bond=20
offering.=20
The state's enlarged role in the utility business was on display when=20
negotiators convened recently at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission i=
n=20
Washington to discuss alleged supplier overcharges. California 's major=20
utilities played only a secondary role, even though they paid much of the=
=20
purported overcharges and ran up giant deficits in doing so. The governor h=
ad=20
named one of his advisers, Michael Kahn, as head of the 20-person state=20
delegation, and Mr. Kahn says the delegation ""spoke with one voice -- mine.=
""=20
Mr. Kahn told FERC that California was owed $8.9 billion in refunds. Others=
,=20
including the FERC administrative-law judge overseeing the talks, said the=
=20
number was probably much lower. The state wouldn't budge, and the talks end=
ed=20
without an agreement. Last week the judge recommended that a ""trial-like""=
=20
proceeding be held to sort out who owes what to whom.=20
Mr. Davis says the state will go to an actual court if it doesn't get all t=
he=20
money it is seeking through the FERC proceedings. And he vows to do whateve=
r=20
else is necessary to get California through the electricity crisis. ""I have=
=20
no desire to subsume the legitimate role of the private sector,"" he says.=
=20
But, he adds, Californians got such a ""raw deal"" from the deregulation mess=
=20
that ""I have had to had take a very militant, hard-line view."""

Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
redlined by hand. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Tony

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

Subject: Need for Business Owner on SAP/Unify Interface

Sally,

Project Apollo has asked me to come up with a functional person from the 
business unit who will be responsible for sign off on the SAP/Unify 
interfaces.   My feeling is that there should be at least one person from the 
Settlements area and one person from Georgeanne Hodges' accounting group 
involved in the signoff.

To date we have been working very closely with Melissa White and Regan Smith 
from the technical side.  Additionally, there have been design workshops 
which have been attended by Lisa  Csikos and Evelyn Aucoin.  

Who would you like to be involved in this process??

If you could please let me know or let me know if you would like to sit down 
and talk about it.

Cindy

Alicia:

For today you had pre-scheduled 29 MW for all hours and had a unit outage 
that started around 8:00 (I think).  For HE 12 - 24 you purchased 25 MW from 
us at $220.  For HE 13 - 24 you purchased 3 MW at $225.  Your schedule will 
therefore reflect 29MW through HE 11, 4 MW for HE 12 and 1 MW for HE 13-24.  
Deviation quantities and ISO purchases will be based on that schedule.

For Wed your  pre-schedule reflects 18 MW On Peak and 21 Off Peak.  Prices 
for tomorrow were 

Peak - $215
Off Peak - $110

We will work to buy this back as well.  We will not pre-schedule anything 
tomorrow morning for Friday and Saturday unless you give us the go ahead.

Prices for tomorrow

 Attached please find the execution copy of the LV Cogen/GE
Agreement (the second document below), which incorporates the revised
Retention Letter amounts.  I have also included a blackline (first
document below) so that you can demonstrate to GE that no other changes
have been made.  To complete the Agreement, the date of execution must
be added to the first page and Exhibit H-2 must be inserted manually.  I
believe that you already have a copy of Exhibit H-2 provided by Lee
Johnson, but I will forward a copy momentarily.

Re: Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement for Austin turbines
I've added the equipment description in Schedule 1 and changed the date of 
the agreement to November 30, 2000 (see attached redlined version).
Ben/Eric - can you verify that my unit numbers in Schedule 1 match your list 
of unit numbers?
David - can you sign off on this for accounting?
Once we have sign-off from accounting, we can circulate the document once 
more with Winston & Strawn.  Hopefully it should be in pretty good shape by 
tomorrow.  Thanks,

Title: High Speed Regulation in California
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2208


A Feverish Pitch
The pace of regulatory and political events in California has taken on the
feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself. Important decisions
regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at=
=20
the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state Legislature,
increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already percei=
ve
in the quickly evolving California market. Sudden changes are being made to=
=20
the
market structure, changes that used to require years in California=01,s com=
plex
regulatory and legislative proceedings.

As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern Califor=
nia
on January 17 and 18, including in portions of downtown San Francisco,
Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley, state officials are scrambling to set u=
p
the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarc=
e
western energy supplies to California=01,s two largest utilities. Even at p=
rices
near $800 per megawatt-hour (MWh), the California Department of Water=20
Resources
(CDWR), attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E=
)
and Southern California Edison (SCE), has been unable to secure enough to k=
eep
the lights on. In the mean time, legal actions by some energy suppliers
threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy=01*and are being held at bay =
only=20
by
direct intervention of California=01,s governor.

Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently:

*California governor. California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt t=
o
act on behalf of PG&E and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from
merchant generation owners and marketers in California. On the same front, =
the
governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them fr=
om
seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utiliti=
es.
Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy.

*Legislature. Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchas=
es
on behalf of PG&E and SCE by the CDWR, to restructure the independent syste=
m
operator=01,s (ISO) governing board to consist of five members appointed by=
 the
governor, to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader=20
interstate
regional transmission organization (RTO) without the explicit approval of
California=01,s Electricity Oversight Board, and to prohibit the divestitur=
e of
the investor-owned utilities=01, remaining generating assets until 2006. Th=
e
vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition =
of
transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still
being developed.

*California Public Utilities Commission. On January 18 the CPUC adopted a
decision prohibiting the sale of SCE=01,s Mohave Generating Station to AES.=
 This
voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed=20
decisions
regarding SCE=01,s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency crit=
eria
for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.

Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their
respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass=20
through
multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to
decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to
California=01,s two largest utilities, or the level of uncertainty in devel=
oping
new generation to supply California in the future.

The ISO anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies (reserves less th=
an
1.5 percent) for January 19 and will most likely continue to curtail
interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are be=
ing
strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water=20
supplies
are already as much as 25 percent below average, owing to low precipitation=
=20
and
continued plant outages near 9,000 MW in California. The gravity of the
financial condition of California=01,s two largest utilities is exemplified=
 by=20
the
need for other, more creditworthy intermediaries, including California
municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers,=
 to
act as temporary  guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PG&=
E
and SCE.

Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.

Taffy/Tana, Thanks for sending us the requested doc.s

Paul, I have started to prepare the mirror English Law doc.s.  Just a few 
questions:

Schedule:

1. Elligible Currency - I presume that in addition to USD we will have 
sterling?  And Euros?

2. Is an Enron Corp. guaranty to be provided?

CSA:

3. Notification time/Resolution time in the US doc.s are 10 am and 1 pm New 
York time respectively.  I suggest that mid afternoon London time should be 
adopted for the convenience of both parties.

Many thanks
Michael"

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Robert Harris"

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

I believe the amount should be calculated through the date of funding.  Will 
closing and funding take place tomorrow, or will funding be a day later?

For ESA to exercise its LM 6000 purchase option, it must pay the Option 
Exercise Price of $101,249,431 (per section 3A of the Option Agreement) plus 
an additional charge of $21,500 per day for each day after November 22d (per 
section 3B of the Option Agreement).  If the option is exercised on December 
20th, the total amount to be paid would be:

Option Exercise Price      $101,249,431
Plus: Additional Costs: $21,500 per day x 28 days =     $        602,000
Option Exercise Price plus Additional Costs  $101,851,431

Thanks,
Rebecca

Mark
how about them Lakers !!!     There is only one thing I can say..... or
maybe 3 words.     MEN AGAINST BOYS !!.      Didn't they just kick ass!
They are peaking at just the right time.     The Dodgers are in first place
and the Kings have gone beyond everyone's expectations.   Life is good in
Southern California.

On the down side,  Ramon got admitted into the hospital over the weekend.
It started out as a  problem with very low blood sugar but then escalated
into a weak heart problem with very shallow breathing.   They have him on a
respirator and plan to wean him off of that this morning.   Cita is all
stressed out but thank god that one of her neighbors is spending the night
with her.      We're getting an update today on some tests performed on
Ramon, so we'll know alot more.

Cita is doing fairly well.    I took her for a four hour heart exam last
week and it revealed that her last heart attack caused some arterial
damage.    The doctor said that if she was younger, he would perform
angioplasty.    In any case, her spirits are remarkably high and is still
mentally sharp.

On another matter,  I got a call last Friday from Ford Motor Credit
regarding your account.    They left a number and asked if you could call
them because ""they have not been able to reach you"".     The number they
left was 877-873-0085.      Apparently, you left me as a reference on the
application.

Hope you are doing ok and am looking forward to seeing you in June!
love ya,
Dave

Article in today's NGI...

 Natural Gas Intellingence, Wednesday, December 6, 2000

Transwestern Adds Receipt and Delivery Points
Transwestern Pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new 
interconnect projects in service or under way, which will add 300 MMcf/d in 
market area deliveries and 285 MMcf/d in new supply receipts. The new or 
expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies 
and markets. 
""There is not a direct relationship between the two [delivery and receipt 
interconnects],"" said Jeff Fawcett, a Transwestern representative. ""It is 
kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have 
ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities 
for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of 
Transwestern."" 
Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Enron unit, 
recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Las 
Vegas with completion of the Southwest Gas interconnect located in the West 
of Thoreau area. 
Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the 
second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery 
interconnect with Citizens Arizona Gas for deliveries to the Griffith Energy 
Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed 
Calpine plant, both located near Kingman in the West of Thoreau area. 
On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect in the East of Thoreau area with Natural Gas Pipeline Co. The 
company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect 
with Enron Oil & Gas located in the East of Thoreau area. The addition will 
bump current supply from 20 MMcf/d to more than 35 MMcf/d. 
Transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early 
next year. The pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100 
MMcf/d at its interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering south of La Plata in the 
San Juan area later this month, and to put a new 50 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering in service by March 2001. The company 
also is planning to complete a new 40 MMcf/d receipt interconnect with El 
Paso Field Services in East of Thoreau which is scheduled to be in service 
January 2001. 
Transwestern Pipeline's system consists of approximately 2,700 miles of 
natural gas pipeline with combined east-west delivery capability of 1.7 
Bcf/day. For further information on transportation with Transwestern Pipeline 
Co., contact Fawcett at 713-853-1521. "

Don 
I want to thank you for passing my Resume to the appropriate person there. I will have a job interview tomorrow with Lydia Delgado (Human Resources) and Marc Dana Davis (not sure what department since Miss Delgado just mention ""Trading"").
I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that another friend of mine is looking into Enron, and I mention him that you could have a position open in your area. He has worked with us for 2-3 years now, and I fully recommend him.
I will ask him to send you a copy of his resume, and I hope that you can help. 
I want to thank you again for your help.

The issue conceivably could be decided this week, since legislators are=20

Looking backward, they will decide how -- or whether -- to erase $3.5 billi=

will choose who, if anybody, will get out of paying for expensive power=20

In both cases, the principle guiding the decision ought to be the same: No=

one is blameless in getting California into this mess, and no group can=20
escape the pain of getting out of it.=20
Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly are searching in vain for ways to hide=

the real costs from voters. Their idea is to have the large users of power=
=20
(mostly big businesses) pay off Edison's past debts. In return, businesses=
=20
would get some freedom to shop for cheaper power deals in the future.=20
The problem is that there won't be much opportunity to shop in the coming=
=20
years. That's because Gov. Gray Davis went out at the very peak of the mark=

and bought up most of the state's future electricity supply before it went =

long-term contracts seemed ill-advised at the time, even more so now.=20
Now that the governor has done all this shopping, the Public Utilities=20

electricity -- $43 billion worth of power over the next decade or so. In=20
addition, the PUC must commit customers to repaying the state for the power=

PG&E Sues State Over Contracts

July 18 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. utility sued=20

Gov. Gray Davis took away Pacific Gas' 12-month forward contracts to ensure=

California estimated the contracts were worth $150 million.

Sacramento -- Lawmakers are struggling this week to agree on a plan to keep=
=20
Southern California Edison from declaring bankruptcy as they rush to comple=
te=20
business before Friday's scheduled summer recess.=20
After months of talking about a solution and dismissing one agreed to by=20
Edison and Gov. Gray Davis, lawmakers now have several competing proposals =
to=20
consider.=20
A plan introduced last week by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman=
=20
Oaks (Los Angeles County), was debated for several hours yesterday, along=
=20
with a GOP-backed alternative by Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles=
.=20
The two plans, which are scheduled for votes today in the Assembly Energy=
=20
Costs and Availability Committee, take sharply different approaches:=20
-- Hertzberg's plan would pay $2.4 billion for Edison's transmission lines =
to=20
help cover the utility's estimated $3.5 billion debt. The utility would be=
=20
allowed to pay off its remaining debt by issuing bonds.=20
The utility would repay the bonds using ratepayer money. For the first two=
=20
years, all customers would pay for the debt, but after that the largest use=
rs=20
would pay off the rest.=20
-- Wright calls his plan a ""straight bailout."" It would allow the utility t=
o=20
issue bonds to cover all of its debt and impose a $2 a month rate increase=
=20
for all users until the debt is paid.=20
The Senate also introduced its own plan. A bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo=
=20
Alto, would give the state a five-year option to buy the transmission lines=
=20
and would have the state back only $2.5 billion of the utility's debt.=20
Since Davis announced a deal with Edison earlier this year, lawmakers,=20
business groups and consumer advocates have all expressed reservations with=
=20
one aspect or another of it. Opposition has usually focused on the state=20
purchase of Edison's transmission lines.=20
The flurry of activity this week is an effort by lawmakers to take some kin=
d=20
of vote before they adjourn. The Edison agreement has an Aug. 15 deadline f=
or=20
approval by the Legislature.=20
Brian Bennett, a spokesman for Edison, said creditors view that date as=20
extremely important.=20
""We're as close to bankruptcy as our creditors want us to be,"" he said. ""Is=
=20
it a drop dead date? I don't know, but it is clearly an important date.""=20
Consumer groups have denounced Wright's plan, and at least one calls=20
Hertzberg's proposal just another bailout and said it would cost California=
ns=20
$6.7 billion over the next 10 years.=20
""We cannot be seduced by big businesses paying a bailout tax,"" said Doug=20
Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
=20
Rights. ""At the end of the day, we know businesses will pass these costs on=
=20
to the consumer.""=20
Included in the 76-page Hertzberg bill are provisions that would allow larg=
e=20
companies to buy their power directly from a provider instead of going=20
through the utility after 2003.=20
But a coalition of large business groups also said they are strongly oppose=
d=20
to the plan because it does not allow for immediate direct access.=20
""Ultimately, we think our companies buying power for themselves is the best=
=20
solution,"" said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and=
=20
Technology Association. ""If businesses think there's a light at the end of=
=20
the tunnel where they see lower rates coming, they might tough it out and=
=20
stay.""=20
Wright argues that the beauty of his proposal is that it could easily apply=
=20
to the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. service area if the company wanted to u=
se=20
it as a way out of bankruptcy court. He estimates that PG&E customers would=
=20
pay about $4 a month to help the company pay off its debt.=20
""This is a straight bailout,"" Wright said. ""This is not a hidden bill. Ther=
e=20
are extras.""=20
Wright said he believes his constituents would rather pay an extra $2 than =
be=20

=20
Business groups said the idea makes sense.=20
""What good would it do to have your electricity bill reduced by $10 or $15=
=20
but not have a job?"" said Bill Hauck, president of the California Business=
=20
Roundtable.=20
Whatever plan is eventually authorized would be used to convince the PG&E=
=20
bankruptcy judge to follow a similar model for that company, giving the sta=
te=20
those transmission lines as well.=20
The purchase of the transmission lines has been at the center of Davis' pla=
n.=20
He argues that the purchase will give the state the ability to upgrade the=
=20
system, allowing a better flow of power between Northern and Southern=20
California and a decreased chance of blackouts.=20
But opponents argue that the state is getting one-third of a complicated=20
system that will cost billions to upgrade and operate.=20
""It's like buying a car with three wheels -- it is not going to get out of=
=20
the lot,"" consumer advocate Heller said.=20

don't think ?anybody anticipated a July like we're experiencing.'' ?Utiliti=
es routinely sell surplus contract power when demand is lower than ?expecte=
d. But the state's recent sell-off could fuel criticism that ?California bo=
ught too much power at too high a price, fearing rolling ?blackouts and soa=
ring prices this summer. ?``There's a painful lesson to be learned when you=
 overbuy when supplies are ?tight,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director=
 of the Western Power Trading ?Forum. ``Anybody can lose money in this busi=
ness, and the state of California ?is getting a taste of that.'' ?The state=
 in the past week has sold anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of its ?available=
 power, Hidalgo said. On Tuesday, the state had up to 40,000 ?megawatts ava=
ilable, while demand hovered around 32,000 megawatts, according ?to the pow=
er grid operator. ?Must be sold ?Because electricity cannot be stored, powe=
r purchased in contracts for a ?later date would be wasted if not used or s=
old. ?``It's better than losing it altogether,'' Hidalgo said. ``The way th=
e ?electricity business is set up, you either use it or move it. You can't =
put ?it in a bottle and put it on a shelf.'' ?State officials would not say=
 how much they've made in sales to offset ?purchase costs, citing concerns =
about jeopardizing their bargaining position. ?According to California Ener=
gy Markets, a trade weekly, the state was ?unloading power last Thursday at=
 $25 per megawatt-hour. Ackerman said the ?state has been selling power for=
 as little as $1 to $5 per megawatt-hour. ?Power was selling on the spot ma=
rket for $20 to $40 per megawatt-hour ?Tuesday. ?The state, which assumed t=
he role of power buyer for California's biggest ?utilities in January, expe=
cted to sell surplus power from time to time, ?although not quite this much=
, Hidalgo said. Even with demand down, the state ?still is buying more powe=
r than it sells, he said. ?With temperatures throughout the West unseasonab=
ly low in recent weeks, other ?utilities also are selling their surplus pow=
er at a loss. ?``That's an accepted operating risk we always assume,'' said=
 Scott Simms, ?spokesman for Portland General Electric, adding that recent =
federal price ?caps are lower than what the Oregon utility paid. ``Sometime=
s you gain, ?sometimes you lose. Hopefully, if you planned well, you end up=
 winning.'' ?Whether the state planned well or overbought is hard to say. T=
he contracts ?could prove invaluable if another heat wave threatens blackou=
ts. Ackerman ?likened power contracts to insurance -- a prudent move to gua=
rd against ?shortages and price spikes, even if it turns out you don't need=
 it. ?At the very least, the current situation underscores the importance o=
f ?weather in the volatile electricity market. Traders pore over forecasts =
and ?even buy weather insurance, Ackerman said. ?Demand and prices have bee=
n so low that some energy companies are shutting ?down the small power plan=
ts called ``peakers.'' ?Hidalgo said the state has no regrets. ?``What we w=
ere doing was making sure we had an available supply with these ?contracts,=
'' Hidalgo said. ``We were facing scarcity in the market early on. ?There w=
asn't enough supply to fulfill the need. What the contracts have done ?is o=
bligated the producers to give us power.'' ?Blackout threat fades ?The stat=
e's daily power costs have fallen from more than $100 million in May ?to le=
ss than $26 million in July, Hidalgo said, and there hasn't been a ?blackou=
t in two months. While some of the surplus power is sold on the ?market, it=
 is also being traded to Northwestern hydropower utilities to cover ?past d=
ebts, he said. ?``This is not a bad position for us to be in,'' Hidalgo sai=
d, adding that the ?situation could always take a turn for the worse. ``We =

The Times Mirror Company ?Pushed by the explosive growth of its trading and=
 wholesale-power businesses, ?Duke Energy Corp. on Tuesday reported a 27% i=
ncrease in second-quarter ?profit, narrowly topping Wall Street estimates. =
?Duke's net income was $419 million, or 53 cents per share, in the quarter =
?ended June 30, up from $329 million, or 44 cents, in the year-ago quarter.=
 ?The consensus estimate of industry analysts was 52 cents per share. ?Reve=
nue for the quarter leaped 43% to $15.6 billion. ?Shares rose 38 cents to c=
lose at $42.03 on the New York Stock Exchange. ?Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke,=
 like other out-of-state independent power ?producers, is under fire from G=
ov. Gray Davis for allegedly overcharging for ?electricity from its Califor=
nia generating plants. ?Duke does not break out its California results, but=
 its profits from soaring ?spot-market prices in California during the quar=
ter probably amounted to no ?more than a penny or two per share, according =
to analyst Jeff Gildersleeves ?of Argus Research in New York. ?California a=
ccounts for about 10% of Duke's U.S. wholesale-power business, ?and about 9=
0% of its California power is sold through long-term contracts ?rather than=
 on the spot market, the company has said. ?Those long-term contracts are a=
 source of worry for investors, Gildersleeves ?said. Neither Duke nor the s=
tate has disclosed whether the contract prices ?can be adjusted downward if=
 spot-market prices fall, he said. If the prices ?are not firm, it could re=
present a risk to future profits, he added, ?especially if spot prices cont=
inue to fall. ?Duke's North American Wholesale Energy business unit posted =
second-quarter ?operating earnings of $251 million, up 128% from $110 milli=
on a year earlier. ?Analyst Timothy M. Winter of A.G. Edwards in St. Louis =
said the overall ?quarter was ""very good,"" considering that Duke's earnings=
 from its ?regulated-utility business in North and South Carolina actually =
were flat ?because of mild weather, a slowing economy and increased costs a=

Subject:	RE: Sept 12 Pinnacle deal

I do remember this deal, we were forced to bookout by some a-hole at pinwest because of the disaster and our inability to secure a scheule from DYPMI and Morgan who was upstream of AEP who was scheduling from home (as was I).  Tom  did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI our sale at Index.  I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.  Holden and Tom and Mark were all aware of this at the time, and one of them may have also modified our deal with DYPMI.

They can throw those deals in, or I can.  Just let me know.

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

I'd be happy to do a newsletter today if you will have a Kaminski's Column.  But, I will be on vacation tomorrow and Wednesday.  Alternately, if things are too hectic for you today, we can always cancel this week's issue and just do one next Monday.

On behalf of Government Affairs, Bob Frank and I thank you for taking time on 
January 11 to join us for the presentation on the potential impact of 
international trade rules on your business units.  I am requesting your 
feedback regarding the trade regulation seminar.  We are trying to gauge the 
level of interest/need among traders, originators and other EIM personnel 
before retaining Powell Goldstein to monitor international trade issues and 
developments for EIM. We spoke to several of you after the seminar and heard 
some interest.    For the pulp/paper group, the most pressing issues related 
to the upcoming expiration of the US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement and 
anti-dumping litigation.  On the steel side, the primary issues include 
ongoing anti-dumping litigation, the possibility of a multilateral steel 
agreement and potential congressional initiatives.  Please e-mail me your 
thoughts or call me at (202) 466-9158.   

As promised, attached below is the power point presentation that Dan Price 
referred to during the seminar (in Lotus Note File Viewer).

P.S. For those of you that attended the afternoon seminar and expressed 
concern about Peter Suchman, he has fully recovered from what turned out to 
be a bad case of stomach flu.

Jason,

I received a response from my tax department and they seem to think that it
might be best to have a conversation with your tax people to better explain
how DLJIC is treated as a US partnership for tax purposes.  It is our belief
that the new regulations becoming effective on 1/1/01 will be helpful
because they will treat DLJIC as a US person.  Please let me know if you
think a conference call will work for you.  Perhaps we can schedule that
when I return from vacation.

Regards,
Suanne

Sally and Brent,
I had noted last week that we were having alot of processing problems with 
SAP and other new processes/set-ups.   I have gotten a commitment from Janet 
Tran and Rena D'Souza who works with Janet on the SAP team to work with us to 
resolve our issues.  
Below is a list of items which Laurel has reviewed with Rena.

Ladies,

To the best of my knowledge, this is the list of items and next steps we 
outlined in our meeting:

1)  ZICI--if errors are made in entry, you must exit and rebook to create a 
2-sided entry.  Diana McLaughlin to review.

2)  ZICI--Prepays on intercompany foreign invoices.  Laurel to contact Pamela 
Lebrane and establish a game plan.

3)  ZICR--report to identify items to be reallocated by trading partner.  Ana 
to create--Rena/Diana to assist if necessary.

4)  BAI codes for activity in Citibank London :  Laurel and Phyllis to 
contact Brian Silver and Lisa Raye

5)  EURO account--items sent back from the bank and posted in USD 
equivalents.  Treasury has been notified and is researching.  Laurel & 
Phyllis to follow up.

6)  ""Not to be posted"" cash.  This causes problems with Cash Application, and 
receivables.  Phyllis/Rena to follow up with Brian Silver & Lori Scott

7)  Autoclear Inflo account--Rena to talk with Becky Ford about putting this 
on as a scheduled overnight job.

8)  Outflow account--Laurel, Cynthia, and Phyllis to continue researching 
outstanding items.  

9)  Yen--Brian Silver & Lori Scott.  Need a solution quickly, as JPY activity 
is increasing--we just had a trader move over to Japan.  

I THINK I covered everything we talked about.   Please feel free to correct 
me!!

Radous/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: RE: EPMI/Morgan Consent to assignment


Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America (""MEGA"").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

Dan, Brent, Shari - 

We have been asked to review the provisions of Truequote - a third party 
trading platform - on which Enron may possibly trade.  I have requested 
access for each of you to the site (www.truequote.com) and hope to have this 
for each of you a bit later today.  In order to get you started, I have 
provided the general product descriptions below.

The use of this system is in conjunction with another deal we are currently 
working on with Truequote which will enable counterparties to hit Enron 
posted prices and transact with Enron through the Truequote site.  

Timing on this matter is rather tight as we need to finalize all agreements 
and be ready to begin using the Truequote site on Monday, March 12.  
Therefore, please initiate a review of the descriptions pertinent to your 
area as soon as possible so that I can coordinate any comments you may have 
with my general comments to the access agreement.  Travis is also working on 
a piece of this deal and will be interested in your comments.

Thanks to each of you.  If you should need anything further, please do not 
hesitate to call me.

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes."

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=

and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =

addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=

product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =

these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=

Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20
West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=
ed by=20
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=
e=20
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=

involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =

If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of

Ina,

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

Mat

Dear Professor Bruner and Ms. Fisher,
 
We have reviewed the web cast from the Darden website of outtakes from Jeff's speech and interview at the Batten Institute event in May.
 
First let me say that both the audio and visual technical issues associated with the first version appear to have been remedied on your end--he now comes across loud and clear!
 
Further, we respectfully request the following edits:
 

In the ""Idea"" section, under subpart 4, please end the audio after the sentence: ""Innovation made money and significant amount of money"".  
In the ""California"" section, under subpart 1, please end the audio after the sentence: ""So it's not a surprise that there is a problem"".
In the ""California"" section, under subpart 5, please end the audio after the sentence: ""So I think you're gonna see a big expansion in wind-generator electricity"". 

Thank you for your cooperation in making these edits.  If you have any questions, please call either me or Ursula Brenner.
 
Best regards,
 
Christie Patrick."

Just a reminder of what we discussed regarding the fate of the Singapore 
office. The trader I mentioned was Pat Markey and he moved there about a year 
ago. He has done a great job on EOL and should be able to give you a good 
overview of the Singapore office both pro and con and how it could be

Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Kay"

Hi Shelley,

Through these stressful times of people moving around and the company restructuring and splitting out the pipelines, I strongly recommend that Darrell Schoolcraft remain with the TW pipeline group as manager/director of this pipeline group. He is very knowledgeable and very professional  in his duties as a coordinator and certainly would make an excellent  manager/director under any new restructuring plan. He's also been very helpful to me and others in maintaining a solid pipeline as well as keeping the lines of communication open between ourselves and our customers. Shelley, for whatever this is worth, he comes strongly recommended for this positon under any type of restructuring plan. Thanks.

Simms Working as First Team QB; Horns Get Pledge from Tyler DB

Sophomore QB Chris Simms worked with the first team during Tuesday's
practice, and, if past practices mean anything, that is a pretty good sign
that he will start Saturday night against Houston.
Simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the
start. Junior Major Applewhite worked with the first team prior to the
Stanford game and he got the start.
Coach Mack Brown won't say who will start at quarterback, but it doesn't
make
a lot of sense to have your starting QB working with the second team, so it
looks like Simms will get his second start Saturday. Simms is more mobile
than Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery, and he also led the
Horns to their first touchdown Saturday at Stanford, despite only getting
14
snaps to Applewhite's 58. Applewhite led the Longhorns to their other two
touchdowns, but they were both in the fourth quarter.
Brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the Texas fans who
are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk
shows
""are hurt. That's the way we feel, too. Our players are hurt and our
coaches
are hurt. None of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play
that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times.""
But he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense
rolling again and shore up the punting team after Stanford scored a
touchdown
on a blocked punt.
Brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its
punter up shorter than usual. ""He's 13 yards back, just like every other
team
in the country, and we try to get the punt off in 2.1 seconds or less. He
got
the one that was blocked off in 1.9 seconds, but a kid who blocked it
perfectly on the other 11 punts let his guy come through untouched, and it
got blocked.""
The Longhorns may have some other punts blocked, but my sources tell me
Brown
chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make
that same mistake again.
Folks, I guarantee you Brown, his assistants and his players are more upset
than any of you over the happenings at Palo Alto and they are working hard
this week to correct things. Remember, the guy the stadium was named after
was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in 20 years at Texas.
Bobby
Bowden is a pretty good coach, too, and his perfect season at Florida State
last year was his first one.
TB Hodges Mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against Stanford, and
the
coaches have corrected that. Brown also said backup TB Victor Ike will play
more Saturday than he has been playing, and he said redshirt freshman Kenny
Hayter also might see considerable action. ""We're going to play as many as
it
takes,"" Brown said. ""We have to get our running game going better.""
He also said LG Derrick Dockery might be able to return to full-time duty
Saturday. He has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized
for
an infected cyst. ""That would help us a lot,"" he said. ""Derrick is one of
our
top offensive linemen.""
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said redshirt freshman Dakarai
Pearson
will start at strong safety Saturday in place of Lee Jackson, who  has a
pulled hamstring and will miss the Houston game.
Reese said Pearson has a lot of talent, but he said Jackson's experience
will
be missed.
Reese also said he will look at freshman Nathan Vasher and juniors Ahmad
Brooks and Ervis Hill to replace Pearson in the Longhorns' nickel and dime
packages. He said the team will play with five and six defensive backs a
lot
Saturday ""because Houston will throw it about 50 times.""
* * * *
ANOTHER RECRUIT COMMITS: Texas has 16 commitments now after getting a
pledge
from Tyler CB Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42. Ross had offers from Alabama,
Arkansas, Baylor, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M and others, but said he
committed
to Texas ""because I've always been a Longhorrn fan, and I really like the
Texas coaches."" He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas
coaches who recruited him, and he said Withers, the Texas secondary coach,
came to see him play in his second game this season. He is a big, fast
corner
with long arms, but don't look for him to get many interceptions this year
because he hasn't had a pass thrown in his direction all year because he is
so good at tight man-for-man coverage.

Susan,

The contact telephone for Rochester seems to have an extra number (typo). Can you tell me what it should be.

Thank you,

Lisa, 

As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized 
that I forgot to talk about 2 people,  including regulatory and your personal 
efforts.  I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize 
how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.  I could not read my 
notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on 
my notes just on me.

Thanks,
Mike"

I spoke to Sabrae,  we are cumulatively balanced with PGE, cumulative and 
don't want to do anything volumetric at either meter.  The NNG OBA is being 
reconciled, and they are really hesitant/reluctant to balance current month.  
Florida can be paid back 5M or more, it is being reconciled, but, Sabrae is 
okay with paying back.  This just in from Mark McCoy, the Oasis OBA is flat 
as of today's gas day.  That should hit the imb. report next week.

From: Governor's Office of Emergency Services

SACRAMENTO - This evening, the Governor's Office of Emergency
Services has dispatched 11 new strike teams (55 engines) to fires
burning throughout Northern California.  This includes 35 local
government and State OES engines that were dispatched to the Emigrant

Gap fire on an 'immediate need.'  Additionally, State OES has
activated its Inland Region Emergency Operations Center and State
Operations Center in Sacramento to coordinate response to the
Northern California fires.
	
Each strike team consists of five fire engines - with three to four
firefighters per engine - and a strike team leader.  The latest
strike teams are being dispatched from the following locations.   

EMIGRANT GAP FIRE
1 OES Strike Team 

1 OES Satellite Communication Trailer

Local Government Engines
Colusa County
Stanislaus County (2)
San Joaquin County 
Nevada County
Tahoe Basin


MODOC COMPLEX FIRE
Local Government Engines
Alameda County
Tahoe Basin

BLUE FIRE
1 OES Strike Team

Local Government Engines
Shasta County
 

Throughout Northern California and Nevada, eight fires have burned
upwards of 100,000 acres so far.  In addition to the recent group of
11 strike teams, OES has also deployed 99 other State OES and local
government fire engines, two state-of-the-art OES satellite
communication trailers, and numerous fire and telecommunications
staff to the Northern California fire lines.  

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue 
Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and federal wildland fire

agencies, and local departments.  The system is designed to ensure
that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions
whenever their own resources are committed or insufficient for a
specific fire.

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,
Kate

Andy / Fritz:
*Please forward this e-mail to Patty Dondanville as I did not have her e-mail
address*  THANKS!

DeDe and I spoke this afternoon regarding the ""Independent Amount"" term in the
EEI Agreement.

Just to provide some feedback from a ""users"" perspective, the ""Independent
Amount"" concept was something that Elizabeth Sager suggested we use as a proxy
for bilateral margining which I introduced at the Sept. EEI meeting in D.C.
This term was literally ""borrowed"" from the ISDA Agreement.

The definition used in the ISDA Credit Support Annex is as follows:
""Independent Amount"" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified as
such for that party in Paragraph 13; if no amount is specified, zero.
(The ISDA Paragraph 13 is synonymous with the EEI Cover Sheet)

There isn't a ""definition"" per se.  The term comes into play in 8.3 as it is
added to the Termination Payment and compared to the Collateral Threshold.  To
put it in another way, it acts as ""buffer"" Termination Payment to handle
additional potential credit exposure created by transactions valued against
extremely volatile price indices.

Please call me in Houston should you have additional questions (713) 207-1211.

Thanks,
Randy

Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been 
over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since 
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter 
needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom 
in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only 
have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.  

Please let me know if this makes sense.

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.

Jeff - you should receive in the next day or so a Security Agreement from our 
lawyers in Bermuda (Appleby Spurling) which has to be executed on behalf of 
ENA.  I have approved these docs - in short the agreement grants us security 
in a Reinsurance Contract which supports RVI's obligation under the Credit 
Default Swap.

I would be grateful if you could sign where necessary and forward all copies 
by courier directly to Sharon White at the following address:

Sharon White
Conyers Dill & Perman
Clarendon House
PO Box HM 666
Hamilton 
Bermuda

Sara - I would be grateful if you could provide the requisite legal 
initials.  On a separate point - Sara - can you confirm that Greg Whalley has 
the authority to sign on behalf of ENA - if so can you have someone fax me a 
copy of the signatory authority.
 
If you have any questions give me buzz.

Many tks

Denis


PS - Drop me a mail when the docs have gone so I can chase-up with Sharon.

KC,

We need a confidentiality agreement relating to asset management services for 
Intergen.  We may have a confidentiality agreement in place - please check 
with K Young.  It probably won't cover this.  Plus, I think this should be in 
the name of EPMI - Reagan, what do you think?

Dear Andreas,

Thanks for the very useful response and information on positions.  I have 
handed over primary responsibility for metals VaR to Kirstee Hewitt (at least 
as far as London is concerned) and she will follow up on the points you 
kindly reported, although I am of course available to assist where 
necessary.  Tanya will remain the point of contact for VaR modelling in 
Houston, and of course Kirstee and Tanya will work together on this to 
resolve these and further issues.  I would be happy to help set up meetings 
for you in the London office when you visit next week, with Kirstee, myself 
and anyone else that you would like to meet with and we very much look 
forward to your visit - please let me know if you need any help with the 
arrangements.

Regards,

Subject: Re:VARMODEL_Live.XLS



Anjam,
thanks for your VAR Model.
I would like to point out the following:
1) Position data: I noted that the outright (longs + Shorts) for copper
include positions which we should not use, i.e. R. Wolff quantities. This
positions are imputed into the system at their integrity (some legs/hedges
are missing)
This affects copper and Lead position for now. The issues should be have
been sorted out by the end of this month, ie next week. So in Copper you
have 25,487 mt to much and with Lead you have 13,579mt to much.(as of June
19)

2) Looking at copper position you calculate a VAR of -3,100,568 with a
total outright of 63.765 mt.
This seams too low. if I calculate 63765 x 1807 x3.99%=4.218 mil. US$. VAR
(outright qty x price levelx risk factor, riskfactr as per Mercur).
In my view we have been understating VaR in Mercur because we do not
consider the spread position correctly (i.e. in detail). On a position like
that I would expect a figure of around 6 mil US$.
I guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period.

3) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as
many fields are blank.

Lets talk tomorrow on the phone.

Attached please find the Position summary for the last week #30 (since June
19) as requested by Kirstee.

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

Team:

We had a very productive meeting with ABB today.  Attending the meeting from 
Enron's side were Drew Tingleaf, Scott Laidlaw, Carlos Sole and Mike Curry.  
Dave Duran and Louise Kitchen spent time emphasizing our commitment to this 
project and some of the steps Enron is taking to see it through to 
conclusion.  

Attending from ABB's side were Svante Svenson (president of ABB HVDC 
division), Lars Carlson (project manager) and Mike Sandridge (sales rep).  

Both parties agreed to the following actions and schedule:

1.  Enron will by April 30, 2001 (Monday):
 a.  draft a letter amending and reinstating the EPC contract of 10/27/00 
(the ""Letter"") and send it to ABB for their comments.
 b.  draft a revised Exhibit Q (cancellation payments).

2.  ABB will, by May 4, 2001, provide Enron with the following: 

 a.  propose a new schedule to the EPC contract (to replace the old schedule 
A-2) providing for both notice to proceed (""NTP"") and corresponding 
guaranteed completion dates (""GCD"") between May 1 and December 31, 2000 on a 
daily basis.  ABB verbally stated their strong commitment towards achieving 
an overall project schedule of 15.5 months between NTP and GCD.
 b.  Revised Exhibit A-1 and Y.

3.  ABB and Enron plan to execute the Letter by May 9, 2001.

I will schedule a team meeting next week to bring everyone up to speed on 
exactly where we are with other aspects of the project.  Please call me with 
any questions you might have at x36649.

I'm in good shape now.  Just a little left for today.

Is Ric getting sentimental?  Losing someone can make you feel that way, even 
if it isn't logical.

We'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow.

Bruce probably hasn't heard from Nick yet.  I'll check again tomorrow.  When 
will you know when you are going to NY?  Sunday?

If you need help with a document, say something, I can help you (stay late 
whatever).  That's what I'm here for.  I figured something was up and I'm 
hormonal, so I've just stayed to myself today.

Ric emailed me about whether to pay his mother's, brother's and sister's way 
down for his birthday.  Now, he never hears from his sister and hardly ever 
hears from his brother except when he sends him his monthly payment that he 
owes him and that's just a check.  I told him to bring his mother down and 
the others can fend for themselves.  I was afraid I would hurt his feelings, 
but he said he felt the same way.  I will not have anyone taking advantage of 
him.  I'd be the same way with my brother if I never talked to him.  Emma 
wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is!!!!  Can you tell I'm hormonal, I'm 
just bitching away.  

Are you ok now with your document?

Sorry I was cranking this am.  I got here at 600am, mostly because I had

Have you heard from Bruce Silvers?  He called and left me a voicemail that he 
was free all day Monday, but he was checking with Nick Palatin.  I haven't 
heard any more from him and was wondering if he called you.  Just following 
up.

Thersa,
I have not spoken to CIG directly about the maintaince.  I was making sure
that everyone was in the loop concerning any CIG business that could have an
impact on Young Storage.  The messages I received talked about Ft. Morgan
Storage Facility. Did not know if FT.Morgan and Young were seperate
facilities or one in the same.

I will fax you the invoice for Young Storage right now.  I understood from

maintenance in August.  Is that your understanding?

If you could please send me that information as soon as possible, I would
appreciate it.

Hi Vince,

It been awhile since we have spoken, hope all has been going great for
you.

I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to
invite you to speak at our conference.

Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am
attaching that to this email.

This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and
attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which
is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.

Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the
US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both
geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for
networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the
presentations are very well attended.

We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have
no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we
can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would
greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a
pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would
consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your
desires and with our program.

As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the
conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle
the travel and hotel.

We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered
reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which
overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information
about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun
golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are
interested.

We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward
to hearing from you.

Thanks

Warren

Sara,

As we discussed, attached is the memo that I wrote last September on the tax 
implications of having a financial trader in Sydney.  As you will note, we 
followed a service fee approach to reimburse the Sydney office on a cost-plus 
basis for the costs incurred by the financial trader (including his 
remuneration).  Important in this arrangement is that the Sydney financial 
trader is not the principal in the trades but is only acting in a preparatory 
or auxiliary manner for the ENA financial trades.

As we discussed yesterday, I will forward the latest draft of the service 
agreement to you by e-mail.  David, could you send Sara and me conforming 
copies of the executed agreement?

Also, we should probably also discuss the status of the documentation 
relating to these trades.

I will be happy to discuss this memo with you in more detail at your 
convenience.

Best regards,
Susan

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for today and 
tomorrow
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled 'Total Reqs' contains the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further
notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy
Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy
elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Whistler/Blackcomb
British Colombia, Canada
    February 24-28, 2001

Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow

....and that's just what it's doing at spectacular Whistler/Blackcomb in
British Colombia, Canada!  The world's top-ranked slopes already boast a
31-inch base with a foot of new powder and 200 open trails!  So dust off
those skis, check out your equipment and pack your bags for the WPO Ski TAG!

Enjoy wonderful days skiing the best slopes with expert guides and
instructors, evening socials in the delightful restaurants at the base of
the mountains peppered with educational sessions including speakers like
Doug Forseth, SVP of Whistler/Blackcomb Operations.  A special evening is
planned for Tuesday the 27th, a celebration of New Orleans' Fat Tuesday!

The best of all worlds is the time spent with family and fellow WPOers
comparing runs, trails, moguls and even the occasional fall.  The rigors of
the day, the friendships of old and new, and the laughter and relaxation of
the evenings are sure to be a highlight of this winter season.

Attached are the articles that I had sent to Steve Kean concerning the offers 
Enron made in San Diego. Please let me know if you need further information.

Thanks,

Gavin Dillingham

SDG&E is entertaining offers from major power companies for a fixed-price
contract to stabilize electricity prices. The utility has received at least
one proposal from Enron Corp. for a multiple-year contract at prices less
than half current levels -- but 50 percent above prices in the spring.



""It's like apples and oranges,"" said Thomas Williams, the Duke spokesman. 
He noted that Roseville had recently secured power at 4.9 cents from Enron
-- a Duke competitor -- but had signed a five-year contract.



SDG&E also said yesterday that it received ""several"" proposals from power
companies to provide fixed future prices for electricity, which involve
long-term contracts touted by power companies -- a ""market solution"" to the
rate roller coaster residents have experienced.

The utility declined to provide a precise number of proposal details but
said it would evaluate the offers over the next two weeks and make
recommendations to regulatory authorities. Peace said earlier that Enron is
expected to be a bidder, offering a fixed price about 50 percent above
rates of last May.


Palmer said Enron could protect consumers from electricity price spikes by
entering into ""hedging"" agreements with local utilities, which are
contracts that provide guaranteed pricing for certain periods. He said the
company had reached such an agreement with the utility servicing Hartford,
Conn.
7/6/2000 SDUT

Duke committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California And a 
Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract



Karen Denne remarks in the San Diego Union Tribune that Enron has offered 
fixed price contracts and that Enron customers have not been effected by this 
price spike. July 25, 2000



The article below states that Enron has put an offer for energy at 5.5 
cents/KWh on the table, and others are
expected to provide a variety of possible deals. July 16, 2000 San Diego 
Union Tribune (SDUT)



Enron has already made one offer, but the
price is too high and the terms are too long. July 11, 2000 SDUT



The local utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, denied reports yesterday that it 
would soon reach an agreement with Enron Corp. on a deal that would lock
in power rates for years for a large segment of its customer base... The 
initial offer from Enron was to provide power for four years at 5.5
cents per kilowatt, according to Peace, who emphasized he hoped SDG&E would 
receive competing bids from other companies.
Hoge said Enron's track record and the nature of long-term power contracts 
made her skeptical that such a deal could save San Diego money.
""With fixed contracts, you always end up paying more than you should on the 
other end,"" she said. ""And Enron always has a way to make these contracts
work for them."" July 11, 2000 SDUT



Concerning Enron ...""This is no better than a boiler fraud on the people,"" 
said Harvey
Rosenfield, who unsuccessfully pressed a ballot initiative to overturn
deregulation. ""They jack up rates over 200 percent -- then they offer you a
deal at a 50 percent hike.

""I don't think the solution to this problem is to put the people of San
Diego at the mercy of Enron.""

Enron is offering to sell San Diego power for four years at 5.5 cents per 
kilowatt hour,
according to Peace. The price would be about 50 percent less than current 
costs, but more than 50 percent above rates paid as recently as this
spring.

Lad,

In keeping with Section 1.1.3.10 of the settlement regarding direct connect
the following changes need to be made.

PG7 Line 12 needs to be changed from ""Delivery points are defined as the
local transmission system, storage, receipt point pools, and the city gate
pool."" to ""Delivery points include the local transmission system, storage,
receipt point pools, and the city gate pool.""

PG7 Line 20 ""Local Transmission user facilities are not to access and
deliver gas supplies from receipt points."" needs to be eliminated.

Parties agreed to put this battle off until later.  Testimony should not
give any preference to one side or the other.  These changes move the
arguments to the center.

Craig

Hello all,

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

John

focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=

opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=

quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=

will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=

that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=

requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20

report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=

relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20

You've guessed it!  Mid Year PRC is around the corner and we must start 
preparing for it.  

In preparation for the upcoming Mid Year Review Process, we will need your 
assistance with the Communication to your groups!  Therefore, we, the Human 
Resources Team for ENA, are requesting your assistance in generating all the 
communication materials needed to your group to make sure we don't leave 
anyone uninformed.   The first two pieces of communication coming your way, 
besides  the e-mail announcements that have recently been distributed, is the 
ever so famous Quick Reference Guides & the new PEP cards.  This time around, 
the Global Performance Mgmt team has decided not to have so many hard copies 
distributed  of the Quick Reference Guides because you are receiving the 
e-mail version copy, as you will find attached below.  The reason behind this 
is that ENA has been through this process for the last few years and the 
Quick Reference Guides contain alot of the same information as in the past, 
and seem to come in much more handy for employees tha are new to the company 
and to the process.

Next, the Global Perf Mgmt team has created this nifty PEP Card that has very 
minimal highlighted information for everyone. 
Please anticipate the PEP Cards in your group this Friday afteroon.  We will 
also get out a few hard Copies of the Reference Guides, but again, it is 
attached below, so please don't anticipate a copy of the Quick Reference 
Guides for everyone in your group.  

We will be sending a follow up e-mail to you all to advise you of the 
schedule for any training classes that will be available before the 
Performance Mgmt system opens on May 15th. 

We ask that you assist us in this process by distributing detailed e-mails 
such as this (addressed to all the Admn Asst's) to your group.  Your 
assistance and cooperation is critical, but most importantly greatly 
appreciated.

Please feel free to contact your HR rep with any questions you may have, and 
also, the PEP Hotline is already currently available to provide all employees 
with Perf Mgmt Assistance.



Thanks again.

Stuart advises that his request equally applies to the option to purchase 
Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. capital stock held by Sundance Assets, 
L.P. ( not the dreaded spark spread option which you worked on in the same 
transaction, which spark spread option was repurchased and terminated some 
months ago ). Let me know when you would like to discuss the matter. The 1997 
Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the option was originally granted 
was signed today ( we are still waiting on an attachment to that agreement to 
be delivered by the other side before we release the document to them), and 
we did modify the option and some transfer restrictions in that Agreement 
that will apply to the Raptor analysis. A registration statement registering 
the CCSI common stock that would be acquired upon exercise of the option was 
filed yesterday with the SEC. Let me know when you would like to meet to 
discuss this matter.

Does the request apply as well to options to purchase? There is an option in 
the Catalytica transaction - recently renegotiated ( we are signing the deal 
up today) to purchase 500,000 plus CCSI shares on a cashless basis. The share 
number is subject to adjustment in a stock split to occur upon the spin off 
of CCSI prior to the merger of its parent sometime before year end. The 
option expires in February 2001.

If any of the Raptor investments for which you are responsible is comprised, 
in whole or in part, of warrants, please provide a copy of the warrants (and 
any related documentation which governs the exercise of the warrants) to 
either Sara Shackleton or Mary Cook.  For the public companies this should be 
done ASAP (i.e. no later than the end of business today) and for the privates 
this should be done by the end of the week.  Also, please arrange to meet 
with either Mary or Sara to provide a brief explanation as to how the 
derivatives work (they need to understand the nature of the derivatives in 
order to properly structure the Raptor hedge).  Once again, I apologize for 
the short notice but hope that each of you recognizes that the internal 
pressure to push investments into Raptor has increased exponentially.  Thanks 
in advance.

Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals.  The 
two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy.  Relient ended up 
buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines.  
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so 
there is a little competition.  The delivery dates are a little further out 
than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.  Hope this helps. Talk 
to you soon.

I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he 
checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he 
gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause 
any problems...

week.  Linda and I will compile closing binders with all the relevant 
documents next week and send you one set for your files.  I will send copies 
of the RBC documents to Rick at the same time.

So, when are you going to come and enjoy our crisp weather?  Mark Taylor 
e-mailed me saying he thought it was a good idea for you to come up here to 
train Linda and Sharon.  It ain't Stampede, but at least Peter and I can

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

Jim et al.:

I heard from Robert Michaels that Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) may be 
interested in sponsoring his study.

Wayne Brough at CSE plans to approach EPSA and others to gauge interest.  He 
said that their president Paul Beckner is scheduled to meet with Steve Kean 
in mid- September on this and other topics.

Wayne said there was some thinking to let Ken Malloy front the study but have 
CSE write a grass roots version given their niche.  Malloy does not want to 
fund raise for his part, however, so CSE might be responsible for both if it 
gets done.

SO, everything is still in the planning stages.

Rick, et al --

I don't know if we need to do this study and the work that Seabron and LECG 
would be doing.  Maybe we incorporate these guys into the mix during the work 
up of the analysis.  

I think that we need to make sure that we have the right questions to ask.  I 
will get with Jeff Dasovich and Joe Hartsoe and Mary Hain to make sure that 
we (1) have the right questions and (2) have the right parties answering the 
questions.  Then let's look at our current resources and go outside only if 
necessary.

Subject: Re: Initial memo on California study proposal  

Robert Michaels is proposing a consultant study looking at the California 
electricity chaos (see attached).  It is roughly a $100,000 study before 
printing and distribution costs with a delivery date of December 1.  The 
study would also involve Ken Malloy's Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets.

I think Robert would do a good job but raise these issues:

1) This is expensive.  It is at consultant rates and is not an academic study 
where a think tank can get the professors to do something at less cost

2) Malloy is pretty heavy into this at a cost of $14,400 of about 40% of 
Michaels.  His NARUC connections are very important, and we would want him on 
the popularization side, but this is too much.

3) The study might need a co-author with lots of academic credibility to join 
Robert as good as he is.

I'm glad that we have this proposal--it will force us to think about what we 
want, who does it, and how it should be distributed.  We should also think 
about how much industry money we could gather to fund such an effort (it 
should be large given the stakes).

Can you provide your impressions so I can get back to Robert?

In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
""LLC"" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:


CA Energy Development I, LLC

Seab/Sabine,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this important issue.  The 
three rule changes or designs in other markets you describe look very good 
and are right on point.  I would like to add two more to your list, namely: 

1) Price caps in California

Attached is a one page memo from my colleague in California, Jeff Dasovich.  
Consistent with Jeff's first two points, Steve Kean has told me that in 
addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, and 
the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in 
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other 
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and 
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have 
ordered.  I have a Nov 10, 2000 Megawatt Daily article that quotes Enron and 
Calpine as saying that price caps in California drove both companies to 
withdraw proposed plants.  

I recognize there is presently no price cap proposal in Alberta but I think 
we can draw the connection between interference through caps and interference 
through other forms of administrative intervention that are being considered 
in Alberta such as: 1) price discrimination on imports, or 2) the latest 
proposal I heard today from the Power Pool which is capping import offers 
into the Power Pool at Mid-C prices plus tranmission costs.



2) FERC Staff Report on Midwest that apparently states on pages 2-15 that 
some market participants believe that developers sited new generation in the 
Midwest because there were no price caps (see attached FERC Report).



As we discussed, I will be using this information in upcoming meetings (this 
Friday is the next one) with the Power Pool and the Alberta Gov't in support 
of Enron's arguments that policy makers in Alberta must ""stay the course"" 
through the higher priced periods, failing which they will make things much 
worse.

In view of the fact it is U.S. Thanksgiving could you please give me a sense 
of Sabine's timing on this.

Regards,

Rob

I don't know what precipitated the onslaught of questions, but as Corporate 
Risk Management is the business charged with the responsibility of dealing 
with United India, one of only four Indian insurance companies, and because 
we have a sizable book of business there and anticipate more,  I need to be 
brought into the loop on what the problem is or what the allegations are 
about. I believe that I am aware of all of the lawsuits filed by various 
Enron entities against insurance companies since 1986, and only one of those 
was filed in Texas.  I believe that Michelle has already addressed that 
issue.  Someone please advise me or Jim Bouillion what this is about."

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much.
I wonder if you could point me to some information
resource on Enron's bandwidth market.

I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor
Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on
the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing
pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ
architecture which is the latest proposal made by
IETF to provide scalable service differentiation.
I would very much like to get in touch with people
in Enron working on the similar topics.

Thank you very much.

These are the preliminary materials I put together over the past few months 
on Texas water issues.  Greg Characklis is most knowledgeable about both the 
issues and the politics, so he can provide briefing/guidance for both my 
replacement and Kathleen Magruder's replacement.

They will be taking representatives from the Lender side, GE and Bechtel, a=

Also, a name has been thrown up as the likely person to represent the Cente=

Godbole panel suggestions unacceptable: Enron, Girish Kuber=20

HOPES that the Godbole committee would be able to renegotiate the Dabhol=20
power project promoted by the US energy major Enron may turn out to be=20
misplaced. The US energy major says that the Godbole committee=01,s suggest=
ions=20
were unacceptable. In response to a query from ET, the company said in a=20
statement that the  =01&published terms of the Godbole report do not repres=
ent=20
an acceptable basis for further discussions.=018  The statement said that i=
t=20
would be meeting the committee next week as =01&a matter of courtesy=018. =
=01&Since=20
the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei=
r=20
thoughts, we will not present any proposals,=018 the statement said. Accord=
ing=20
to highly-placed sources in the government, the company has informed the=20
Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May 11. Earlier reports ha=
d=20
indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May 5.=20

According to sources, Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives=
=20
of its lenders and shareholders. The Godbole committee, that studied the=20
current power purchase agreement, has called for cancellation of the presen=
t=20
tariff structure, renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract, removal o=
f=20
dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned, deb=
t=20
restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power=20
purchase agreement. These suggestions, it seems, may not be acceptable to=
=20
Enron. The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole=
=20
committee to renegotiate. The committee has been given a month=01,s time to=
=20
renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA.

The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of 5 mmpta is far in=
=20
excess of what is required by the plant (only 2.1 mmpta of which 1.8 mmpta =
is=20
on take or pay), it should be separated into a distinct facility whose=20
capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge, not as take or pa=
y.=20
It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow=
er=20
generation. Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF.=
=20
Instead, the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro=
n=01,
s own Metgas. =01&It is important to distribute the cost over the entire=20
capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant,=018 says the=20
committee. Similarly, it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the=
=20
harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers. On the LNG=
=20
contract negotiated by Enron for long-term supplies, it has said that since=
=20
the LNG market has witnessed great changes, particularly as far as prices a=
re=20
concerned, the power company should take advantage of spot buys and=20
renegotiate the contract accordingly.

Enron ready to take part in PPA talk ,  Nitin Yeshwantrao

The Enron management has finally agreed to  participate in a 'discussion'=
=20
with the Madhav Godbole-led re-negotiation committee set-up to facilitate=
=20
the  restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the=
=20
US power major and the state government.Officials of Dabhol Power Company=
=20
(DPC), a subsidiary of Enron, alongwith their team of shareholders and =20
lenders will arrive here on May 11 for talks with the  nine-member Godbole=
=20
panel.Though the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation, a k=
ey=20
Mantralaya official told The times of  India that the team had expressed=20
willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the=20
imbroglio.

Enron's response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the=
=20
controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks, with the board of=
=20
directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a=20
termination notice to MSEB. The state government, on its part, too adopted =
a=20
confrontational position by slapping a Rs 401 crore rebate charge on DPC fo=
r=20
defaulting on power supply.However, the sudden change of heart by the Enron=
=20
management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le=
d=20
by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) which had recently opposed t=
he=20
move to pull out of the project. This was in contradiction to the stand tak=
en=20
by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes=
=20
on disbursement of funds to DPC. The Congress-led Democratic Front governme=
nt=20
had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to=20
renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o=
f=20
both the parties.

Last week, the state government constituted a nine-member panel of experts=
=20
under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole. Godbole had written to the DPC=20
management inviting it for talks to re-negotiate the PPA on May 5. For the=
=20
delayed response from Enron, the meeting has been rescheduled to May 11.The=
=20
issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the=
=20
LNG facility from the power plant, renegotiating LNG supply and shipping=20
agreements, redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a two-part=20
tariff. The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar=20
denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra=20
government to sell power to third parties.

the increased rate will come into effect from January,  2002 following=20

Rick,

I was able to speak w/Greg and Mike McConnell on your Napa Valley 
conference.  Unfortunately, Greg nor Mike are able to attend.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

Greg -

Thanks for giving some additional thought to sending an Enron representative 
to
Chase H&Q's Energy and the New Economy conference. I think your suggestion of
Mike McConnell is great  -- in fact I saw a piece on energy e-business in
Sunday's Chronicle in which Mike was heavily quoted albeit in his former role 
as
CEO of Enron Global Technologies. I don't know Mike well but met him a couple 
of
times in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTL
situation.

Anyway, you had asked about other presenters and format.

The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 
-
15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books for
audience members to take away. Following the formal presentations there will 
be
questions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by all
panel members.

Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panel
the moderator will be yours truly -- so I'll be serving up some softballs for
Mike.

The other confirmed panelists for the Energy Exchange session are:

Houstonstreet.com -- Howard Smith
Enemetrix.com - John Gaus
Downstream.com - John Ireland

We are expecting good attendance from industry (both incumbants as well as new
economy types) as well as from the buyside. So far there are over 100
participants and I expect we see a number of additional confirmations between
now and the conference.

Logistically, Mike would need to fly to San Francisco on Wed Sept 20 -- we 
will
work with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley. The panel 
will
be first thing on Thursday Spet 21 (probably around 9 am) after which Mike 
will
be free to attend other conference sessions, play golf, tour wineries or
whatever.

The full list of sessions  includes:

Distributed Generation
Communications
B2B
Investor Perspectives
Energy Exchanges
Energy Retail
Venture Stage
European New Energy

Pursuant to Section 25.2(a) of Columbia's tariff, Columbia is providing notice 
of the imposition of the following additional gas quality specification on all 
shippers, interconnecting pipelines, producers, and receipt meter operators, 
and all other parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into Columbia's 
system:

     All gas tendered under Columbia's tariff shall have a gross heating value  
    of no more than 1050 Btu per cubic foot.

This additional gas quality specification will be imposed two (2) business days 
after this notice is posted on Columbia's internet electronic bulletin board.  


In addition to complying with this additional gas quality specification, all 
parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into the Columbia-operated 
Blue Water system on the Western Shoreline, the Southwestern Extension, or on 
the Header (west of the system null point) may be required to provide evidence 
to Columbia that such gas is being processed at the Blue Water Processing Plant 
to ensure that the composite gas stream at Egan, Louisiana has a gross heating 
value of 1050 Btu or less.  Evidence of the gas processing agreements may be 
required upon Columbia's request.  

Failure of a party to comply with the additional gas quality specification set 
forth above and to provide Columbia Gulf with evidence, upon request, of a gas 
processing agreement for gas delivered to the Blue Water system will result in 
Columbia Gulf refusing to accept gas from such party and to make corresponding 
redeliveries.

Imposition of this additional gas quality specification does not relieve any 
party delivering gas or causing gas to be delivered to Columbia's system from 
its existing obligations to comply with the gas quality specifications set 
forth in Section 25.1 of Columbia's tariff, to ensure the merchantability of 
the gas, and to ensure that gas has been properly processed before entering 
Columbia's system.

Columbia, pursuant to the terms of Section 25.2(a) of its tariff, is imposing 
this additional gas quality specification as it has determined, in its 
reasonable judgment, that harm to its pipeline system and its operations may 
occur if it receives gas on its system that fails to meet this additional gas 
quality specification.  Columbia reserves the right to revise this additional 
gas quality specification upon further analysis of the gas that is being 
received by Columbia and reevaluation of the potential harm to Columbia's 
pipeline system and its operations. 

You are further placed on notice that Columbia will hold you responsible and 
seek legal redress for any damages it incurs as a result of the higher Btu 
gas.

Any questions about this notice may be directed to Gary Espey, (713) 267-4761, 
or to John Pillion, (713) 267-4764.

Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes.  You will see the 
change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily.  We want to put this item 
on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we 
need to resolve before coding begins.  The focus for now should be on putting 
physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve 
questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, 
design of the new screens, etc.  

Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and 
Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously 
with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, 
CPR, ERMS & TAGG.  I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know 
the time and place of next week's meeting.  Normally I want to hold the 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to 
Tuesday.  I will let you know first thing Monday morning.  Let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns.

Subject: QF situation good example of why price caps make things worse; what
 Sokol said at press conference yesterday

This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; 
they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a 
scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and 
the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply 
and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be 
doing.

FYI:  I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case 
freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.  Sokol blasted Edison over and over 
(e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).  Sokol said that, 
at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically 
to force an involuntary.  Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar 
tack.  Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's 
of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out 
of state).   He said he expects to get a ""market price"" from El Paso and that 
if the ""prices are higher out of state, well.......""

Best,
Jeff

? The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This 
will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it 
with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year 
contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, 
this is ""locked in to pass.""  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on 
Monday.
 
? The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they 
would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to 
operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired 
QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to 
either operate unprofitably or shut down.
 
? The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an 
involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram 
Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in 
Nebraska).  Sokol is described  by sources as ""extremely aggressive."" 
 
? An involuntary bankruptcy filing appears imminent.   Sources believes the 
trigger event will either be the legislative passage of the plan  tomorrow or 
the PUC order implementing the plan on Monday.

Enron will be hosting our previously scheduled bank meeting on Monday, November 19th at 2:00 p.m. EST.   The meeting will take place at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan. 

As previously stated, this meeting will be for Enron's bank relationship and credit officers only.   As such, identification will be checked at the door. If you have not already returned your institution's Confidentiality Agreement, please fax it back to Mary Border's attention at 713.646.3422 by noon, Friday, November 16th.  Please note that there will not be a call-in number or video-conference for this meeting.

Please reconfirm your attendance with Mary either by email (mary.border@enron.com) or by phone (713.853.0941) as soon as possible.

We will be covering information on the pending merger, our current financial situation, and more details on our structured financings. 

I realize that all of you have requested more information than we have been able to provide over the last few weeks. Thanks for your patience and I look forward to seeing you Monday. 

Regards,

Kelly Boots

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members."

I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our 
Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes 
Master Swap Agreement database.  I understand that you are the person that 
can get them access.  This will continue to be an issue as we expand our 
trading offices around the world.  Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant 
General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent 
and Andrea access.

Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a 
database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.  How does Brent go about 
getting this new database created?

Thanks for your help!"

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

The South Central Team has discussed Debra's Corrective Action Report and feel that she has met the demands we placed on her at the time the report was issued.  We have seen Debra work hard to get up to speed on our various interconnects and other procedures this year.  Debra has sharpened her focus on our business, gained competence in all areas requested, and is now able to support the team when needed.  We therefore request that this report be removed from her file. 

 Please let me know if anything more is needed to complete this updating for Debra. 

Thank you,

JDS UNIPHASE'S WHITE-HOT Q1
The optical networking component maker's fiscal Q1 earnings came
in looking strong. Will they be enough to reverse this week's
mass sell-off in the sector?


By Dave Marino-Nachison

An upbeat fiscal first-quarter earnings report from fiber optic
components leader JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JSDU) following last
night's bell perked up investors in after-hours trading, pumping
the stock 12%, after a 25% plummet on Wednesday. JDSU and other
fiber optics companies, such as Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)
and Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN), have been capsized by the wake of
Nortel's (NYSE: NT) earnings report from earlier in the week.
(Nortel is a major customer of JDSU.)

Nortel's optical networking division didn't grow as quickly as
some analysts hoped, which compounded another recent
disappointment from Lucent (NYSE: LU). But Rule Maker JDSU's
results sparkled: Revenues rose 171% year-over-year and, at $785
million, overcame the projections of market watchers. Pro forma
net income rose 29% to $0.18 per share, beating Street forecasts
by two pennies.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171083
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171084

Now JDSU expects to earn $0.80 per share -- a dime better than
expected -- for the fiscal year, CFO Tony Muller reportedly said
on a conference call. He also pointed investors toward top-line
growth of between 115% and 120%. ""Optical demand is good and
healthy,"" a Robertson Stephens analyst told Bloomberg.

""We believe demand remains strong,'' COO Charles Abbe was quoted
as saying. He maintains the company isn't seeing the inventory
channel grow fat at the expense of future sales: ""We can't find
any meaningful evidence of an industry slowdown.'' Look for Q2
pro forma earnings of $0.19 or $0.20 per share, execs said,
compared with $0.17 as projected by Wall Street.

While short-term market movements are of little interest to
Fools, today's trading should prove interesting as investors
work to make sense of the recent rash of seemingly conflicting
indications. While some might say the fiber optic sector was
merely due for a ""correction"" of sorts, of greater importance
are clues about the sort of demand that lies ahead to justify or
confound even today's damaged -- but still extremely high --
valuations.

Demand for the components that speed data transmissions and
fatten networks to meet skyrocketing bandwidth needs isn't
expected to slow significantly for the next several years. For
more information, check out a column Richard McCaffery wrote
back in July.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171085
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Kellogg (NYSE: K) agreed to buy Keebler Foods (NYSE: KBL) for
$3.86 billion, or $42 a share, a 4.4% premium over Keebler's
$40.44 close yesterday. Kellogg will triple its debt load to
swallow Keebler, but buying the No. 2 cookie and cracker maker
helps it diversify its core breakfast cereals business, which
has seen no growth for a decade. Keebler and No. 1 snack maker
Nabisco Holdings Corp. (NYSE: NA) compete in a market growing at
4% a year. Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) will join its Kraft division
with its planned purchase of Nabisco Holdings, not to be
confused with Nabisco Group Holdings (NYSE: NGH), to be
purchased by R.J. Reynolds (NYSE: RJR).

Leading biopharmaceutical company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) reported
a pro forma 12% increase in revenues and an 18% increase in
earnings for the quarter ending September 30. However, the
company forecasted slower sales for its two main revenue
producers, Epogen and Neupogen, and said that approval of its
Kineret rheumatoid arthritis treatment could be delayed until
the second half of next year. Amgen's shares dropped to $59.50
in after-market trading, from $68.50 at the day's close.

Big-shot hedge fund manager Jeffrey Vinik announced that he was
returning most of the $4.2 billion in assets of Vinik Asset
Management so he can spend more time with his family. Most
investors remember Vinik, 41, as the manager appointed to
replace legendary Peter Lynch at Fidelity's Magellan Fund. Vinik
Asset Management reportedly turned in a four-year 645% return to
investors, 440% after fees.

Beleaguered Belgian voice recognition software maker Lernout &
Hauspie Speech Products (Nasdaq: LHSP) announced it would
resolve confidentiality agreements and release to Securities and
Exchange Commission and European Easdaq exchange investigators
the names of 30 investors in closely held companies that Lernout
says are customers. These Belgian and Singaporean companies
figure prominently into accusations of impropriety concerning
Lernout's Asian divisions' revenues. The Wall Street Journal has
run several stories hitting the company hard for alleged
questionable accounting, but the company has maintained that its
practices are legal and common in Europe, but misunderstood by
Americans. The disclosure news sank the stock price another 35%.

I think it is sad that he died but I 'm certainly fine.  He was pretty old 
and I really was not really close to him though, but he was a very nice and 
intelligent man.  About 8 years ago, I went to Utah on business with Dupont 
and I stayed over the weekend with him.  He took me all around Salt Lake City 
and showed me a bunch of neat stuff.  That's what I will remember about him 
most.

California State Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press  conference this 
afternoon to announce that $3.5 billion in interim financing has  been 
arranged through J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers, and that an additional $1  
billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an 
undisclosed  source.
?
The financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued  yesterday by 
the governor that allows bond?sales for energy purchased by  the Department 
of Water Resources.? Previously, Gov. Davis and Treasurer  Angelides had 
sought legislative approval of the bond issuance, but were not  successful.? 
Further review by state attorneys determined that the governor  could 
authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference  that 
the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be  
used?to backfill past general fund expenditures.? 
?
A one-page?handout summarizing the financing has been  sent to Houston.??The 
vital statistics are:

The authorized loan amount is $5 billion, with an initial  $3.5 billion 
committed;
The rate is 4.75%, but will jump to 7% if the bonds are not  issued 
successfully by October 31, which is the scheduled maturity date of the  loan 
(Angelides emphasized that this is not the due  date).

The goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from  the general fund 
for power purchases and avert a cash crisis.? The  financing, which also 
provides working capital for continued?state energy  purchases,?is secured by 
revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid  by the bonds.
?
Angelides noted that the financing, which he hopes to have  totally closed by 
July 1, precludes generators from walking away from contracts  under the 
clause that requires financing by a certain date.? He said it  satifsies 
""most"" DWR contracts and?precludes arguments made by generators  for a 
""credit premium.""
?
Angelides also said that the financing is important because it  ""builds 
momentum"" for the huge revenue bond sale and that it ""sends a powerful  
signal to Wall Street that the bond issue is real.""
?
According to his figures, the general fund is currently out  about $5.2 
billion net ($6.1 billion in purchases minus $900 million in  revenues) in 
power purchases through June 12.
?
Steps still must occur before the bonds can be issued, he  said.? The PUC has 
to adopt rate agreements, adopt a servicing order with  the utilities to 
collect revenues to repay the bonds, and has to enact rate  increases of 
about 3 cents/kwh in SDG&E's territory.? Angelides noted  that the lenders 
have made their financial commitment event though these PUC  actions are 
still outstanding.
?
The bonds will not be issued until early September.?  Angelides said late 
August is a terrible time because the financial community is  on a pre-Labor 
Day holiday and that the state would hold off until the more  favorable 
period following the holiday.
?



?
Earlier in the afternoon, the Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights -- 
Harvey Rosenfield's group -- held a press conference to voice  opposition to 
the Edison MOU.? They all seem to agree that the MOU is  likely dead, but are 
afraid of it arising at a later date in some form.  
?
When asked about the business community being asked to  shoulder the costs of 
utilities' debt, Rosenfield said that a problem has arisen  in that business 
wants direct access but DWR has already purchased the power  they ""don't 
want.""? He believes Edison alone should be responsible for its  debt; it's 
government's role to go forward, he said, and Edison's job to ""clean  up its 
mess.""
?
Rosenfield cautioned that if legislators ""make the mistake of  paying one 
more penny"" towards a bailout there will be a referendum on the  bailout and 
the legislators voting for it.? He said they would be  held personally 
accountable.
?
(Exactly what he means by this is unclear.? In  California, a ""referendum"" -- 
which is the word he used -- is a little-used tool  to overturn legislation 
that has been passed and signed.? Whether he was  threatening recall attempts 
is also unclear.)
?
Rosenfield added that depending on how things progress, there  could be an 
initiative and it could include a public power  component.
?
The press release issued at the press conference, which also  featured Harry 
Snyder of Consumers Union, has been forwarded to Houston.?  It is also 
available through this link:

Subject: Re: TW LFT  

I agree with Glen's comments,  anything greater than the allowed MDQ can flow 
or be scheduled, but it would be at the IT rate.  Based on the contract, the 
overrun rate is usually the same as the firm rate so I don't believe there is 
a revenue issue.  Keep in mind, when a day is limited the mdq is ""reduced"" 
systemiatically  to that level so anything greater is overrun.  MK

Subject: Re: TW LFT  

Although I would like to collect the LFT revenue in the second example on 
60%, isn't the extra unanticipated  10% TI? The tariff is vague in regard to 
partial days.  It appears we could call a partial limited day  based on a 
percentage of the MDQ or a specific volume level however once we have 
announced the firm level haven't we made a commitment only to that level of 
MDQ on a firm basis and any other volumes that might flow would be regarded 
as overrun?

Subject: TW LFT

I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to 
TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks 
ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called 
(for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any 
percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper 
would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a 
Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage 
would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest 
could be scheduled IT.  

Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this 
change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT 
shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were 
in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to 
notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity 
in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put 
their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against 
Azurix Corp.

10/16/2000
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2000--Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, 
P.C. hereby gives notice that a class action complaint was filed in the 
United States District Court, Southern District of Texas on behalf of a class 
of persons who purchased the common stock of Azurix Corp. (NYSE:AZX) 
(""Azurix"" or the ""Company"") at artificially inflated prices during the period 
June 9, 1999 through August 8, 2000 and traceable to Azurix's Initial Public 
Offering (""Class Period"") and who were damaged thereby. 
If you are a member of the proposed Class, you should contact this firm at 
the telephone number or address below. If you wish to be appointed lead 
plaintiff in this action you must file a motion with the Court no later 
December 5, 2000. Class members must meet certain legal requirements to serve 
as a lead plaintiff.
If you purchased Azurix common stock during the Class Period or have 
questions or information regarding this action or your rights, you may call 
or write Barbara A. Podell, Adam Savett or Renee C. Nixon, of Savett Frutkin 
Podell & Ryan. P.C. at 800/993-3233 or via e-mail at sfprpc@op.net. 
The complaint charges Azurix and certain of its senior officers and directors 
with violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 
(""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. 
The complaint also charges Enron Corp. as a controlling person under Section 
15 of the Securities Act and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint 
alleges that during the Class Period, defendants disseminated to the 
investing public false and misleading financial statements and press releases 
concerning the Company's publicly reported financial condition and future 
prospects. 
The complaint further alleges that defendants issued to the public on or 
about June 9, 1999, in connection with the Company's initial public offering, 
a false and misleading registration statement and prospectus. These documents 
touted the Company's primary business strategy - acquiring, owning, operating 
and managing large privatization water supply and wastewater projects. 
However, through a series of partial disclosures beginning on March 30, 2000 
and ending on August 8, 2000, it was revealed that several large 
privatization projects were already postponed or canceled at or near the time 
of the IPO. As a result of defendants' misrepresentations the price of Azurix 
common stock was artificially inflated throughout the Class Period. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Azurix 
common stock during the Class Period. The plaintiff is represented by Savett 
Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. which has extensive experience representing 
shareholders in class actions and has successfully recovered hundreds of 
millions of dollars for defrauded investors and shareholders. 
The reputation and expertise of the firm in shareholder and other class 
action litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have 
appointed the firm to major positions in complex class action litigations.

Dave,

Kevin McConville was deposed yesterday in Houston.  His rough transcript is
attached.

The deposition questioner jumped around and never went through the whole story
front to back, so you may not find this that helpful.  However, there is a
passage near the end where Kevin talks directly about Schultes' getting fired.
 You should be able to find this quickly by doing a word search on Schultes.

Thanks. I put in a call to those guys and am waiting to hear back. In the 
meantime, maybe you could call their in house counsel to get reaquainted 
since you've already worked together...

One other item - the Pompano developers agreement - I need to talk to you 
about this tomorrow (early if possible) as local counsel is waiting for our 
comments. I heard rumor that AEW was still working on this despite her 
vacation. In any case, we need to get some comments back to Debbie Orshefsky 
on Thursday if possible.

Regards,

Ben

Doug:

Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening 
events.    I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD 
CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be 
attending.

However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work 
schedule.

Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION  
luncheon on the 11th.

Thanks,

Come out with a whole bunch of cool new machines and your stock gets 
whacked.  What a weird deal that is.  Anyway, when do you think the new IMacs 
will be out in stores?  I still havent' got around to buying Sandra her IMac 
and now she thinks she wants the IMac notebook so its a good thing I didn't 
do this last month.  Do you concur that the new ones are worth the wait or 
should we pick up an old one on mega sale once stores start clearing the old 
ones out?  DF "

Today I received a somewhat unpleasant letter from Mr. Mark Wilson at Koch.  
Koch is saying that it has been damaged by the delay in the registration of 
its EOTT common units and is making veiled threats of legal action against 
EOTT.  The tone of Mr. Wilson's letter is inappropriate in my view.  I will 
send each of you a copy of Mr. Wilson's letter and I will work with Bob Baird 
in framing an appropriate response from EOTT.  At this juncture, since it now 
appears that it will be at least several more weeks before we know whether 
the Phoenix deal will become ""disclosable,""  it might make sense to advise 
Koch about Phoenix on the condition of strict confidentiality (Dana's 
suggestion).  Bob, could we do this?  If we could do this, Koch would be able 
to appreciate the dilemma posed by the Phoenix deal and how this impacts the 
S-1 filing.  SWD"

Subject: ERCOT load growth: Q12000 to Q12001

The actual mwh growth from Q12000 to Q1 2001 was 3.56% (59,426,845 mwh to 
61,543,268 mwh).  Through my calculations, which I will describe below, I 
arrived at a weather-normalized growth of 4.28% (59,114,067 mwh to 61,646,157 
mwh).  While I would not say that load growth exactly matches my figure, I 
feel confident that load growth in ERCOT was in the range of 3.5% to 4%, year 
over year.

Methodology

To arrive at the 2000 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/97 through 12/31/99) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2000.  I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2000 loads.  The 
amount of data I used to estimate the ERCOT model in this example is standard 
for each of the load forecasting models I have developed (when that amount of 
data is available). 

To arrive at the 2001 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/98 through 12/31/00) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2001.   I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2001 loads.

I then compared the results, which I have summarized above.

Let me know if you have any questions."

Monica,

Things are a little bit unsettled right now. I am working on them and will have something shortly.
Your patience is appreciated.

Ben,

I found that you should have considered that power plant will operate from 
June 2001, which means we can only realize the spread option value of 7 
months, not of a whole year. Please make the changes as well as clean up the 
""Opion"" page. We should start to think about going to RAROC and to scrub the 
model.

What is the source of the financing assumptions?

Besides Teb, who should I get approval from to change invoice due dates of the 11th or 20th that fall on a Saturday or Sunday to a due date of Friday, based on the tariff.  Or should I simply put out a message to marketing, Teb, Fraizer to announce the planned change?  Currently we're sending invoices out with the Sat/Sun date.  "

We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Greetings:

See attached ""meeting notice.""  This could be a good opportunity to get our 
demand-side proposal on the table.  

Dennis:  If we could get some power point slides together, we could present 
our ideas to this group and the leg aides mentioned.  Let me know your 
thoughts. 

Also attached is a summary of the bill that the CA Assembly passed today.  
Please pass this along to others who might be interested. Thanks.

Jeff

Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I 
had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling 
different factors.  

Let me know how the position looks tonight.

		 Subject: FERC/SEC Update

As you all may know, we have scheduled a conference call for the group for 
Thursday, Oct. 19.  Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should 
be on your calendars.

As a brief update prior to our call:

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger.  Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding.  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill 
Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.

Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, 
Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this.

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.  
As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission 
Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.  While RTO progress has 
been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' 
commitment to join an RTO.

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company.  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this ""alternative"" type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Sarah

   Why don't I call you after I ask Michael?  I don't know what he has
in mind for entertainment.  Also, what is your cell phone number in case I
can't reach you at work?

My trip cancelled, so I'm around.  I can pick Michael up at your place if
this is easier for you.

Vince,

Thank you very much for the follow up report.  I am sure Richard will be very 
enthusiastic about the opportunity to speak with you and your team.  I 
appreciate your help, and please feel free to contact me if you or Shirley 
need assistance with logistics.  

Again, thank you and I look forward to working with you again this recruiting 
season.

Kristin,

Thanks a lot for the resume.
We shall arrange a phone interview with Richard. This is out standard

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in 
becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab 
experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back 
to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the 
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel 
I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the 
qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

The next step is to incorporate the intra-day market movement by using high 
and low
prices into the pricing.  I will call you on Monday.

Happy Thanksgivings !

Zimin

As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

Nine consultants divested by a noon deadline, but critics said Gov. Gray=20

The order, issued at Davis' direction, was contained in a memo to Tom=20

Secretary Barry Goode wrote that it was ""imperative that you give this=20

""We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the=

Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes t=

last week to obtain statements of economic interest from the energy=20
consultants. The consultants were brought on earlier this year to help the=

The economic statements revealed that several consultants held stock in=20
energy generators, including Calpine Corp. and Enron. One consultant report=

that he sold stock holdings in Edison International and Dynegy when he bega=

Administration officials initially said they would review the reports for a=

But Goode's memo, dated Wednesday, said each of the consultants should dive=

he=20
notice was given to the 34 people who had disclosed their interests as=20

State Attorney General Bill Lockyer, whom Jones had asked to investigate,=

told Jones in a letter Tuesday that most of Jones' allegations, including=

whether the statements of economic interest were filed on time, should be=

Jones said simply selling the stock doesn't solve the problem.=20
""Just divesting themselves of the stock, or even letting them go, doesn't=

Another contempt action=20
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 19, 2001)=20
A state Senate committee held another energy generator in contempt Wednesda=
y=20
and may recommend today that Enron Corp. either pay fines or be removed fro=
m=20
California's marketplace if it continues to withhold documents.=20
Meanwhile, lawmakers in both houses spent Wednesday night debating three=20
plans to prevent Southern California Edison from going into bankruptcy,=20
though no one idea had broad support.=20
The committee's action against Reliant Energy marked the third contempt=20
finding in as many weeks by the special Senate committee investigating ener=
gy=20
market manipulation. After reaching a legal disagreement over whether trade=
=20
secrets would be protected, lawmakers voted 6-0 to push Reliant, a=20
Houston-based generator, into contempt proceedings.=20
The panel found five other generators in compliance with subpoenas after th=
ey=20
signed confidentiality agreements earlier this week and promised to ship=20
thousands of files to depositories.=20
Three weeks ago, the committee found Enron and another generator, Mirant, i=
n=20
contempt. Mirant has since cooperated and escaped the committee's finding,=
=20
but Enron filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court seeking judicial=20
intervention.=20
Despite ongoing discussions between the committee and Enron representatives=
,=20
they have reached no deal to end the lawsuit or the contempt finding.=20
Lawmakers therefore intend to issue a report today leading to a later Senat=
e=20
vote on contempt and subsequent penalties.=20
The committee was considering two possibilities late Wednesday, said its=20
chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. The first would impose fines that=20
compound each successive day Enron remains in contempt. The second would=20
exclude the Houston-based marketer from selling energy in California until =

""We're reviewing the (legal) basis for such a recommendation,"" Dunn said.=
=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he had no response to the potential=20
penalties but stressed that his company is still discussing the contempt=20
matter with lawmakers.=20
In Reliant's case, lawmakers and the company disagreed Wednesday over wheth=
er=20
the committee's own confidentiality agreement affords enough protection of=
=20
trade secrets.=20
Reliant attorney Charles Stevens said his company would rather have a court=
=20
order to ensure that its proprietary information would be safe. But committ=
ee=20
members objected to involving the state's judicial branch, charging that it=
=20
would disrupt the separation of powers.=20
Several times during the hearing, Dunn conceded that Reliant, like Enron, m=
ay=20
ultimately resort to a lawsuit to resolve its disagreement with the=20
committee.=20
""We have not made that decision at this time,"" said Stevens, the Reliant=20
attorney. ""We've always preferred to resolve the dispute with the committee=

informally, and we continue to look for ways to do that.""=20
Should Reliant work out an agreement with lawmakers by cooperating with the=

(Published July 19, 2001)=20
Sparking accusations that it's abandoning its watchdog role, the Public=20
Utilities Commission took the first step Wednesday toward promising to rais=

rates as much as necessary to pay the state's electricity bills.=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch released a proposed version of the promise -- a=

The full PUC is scheduled to vote on the agreement Aug. 23.=20
It's unclear whether the agreement will lead to a rate increase any time=20

this week, says it doesn't think the new numbers will generate another rate=

Still, consumer advocates said the rate agreement would represent a surrend=

of the PUC's traditional job of protecting ratepayers.=20
The agreement would permit ""an unaccountable state agency, riddled with=20

PUC May Cede Control Over Electricity Rates
Energy: Chief says letting the state water agency set prices would ensure=
=20
that ratepayers cover costs. Others say plan would leave public unprotected=

July 19 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- California's chief utility regulator proposed Wednesday to=
=20
provide rubber-stamp approvals of any future electricity rate increases tha=
t=20
state power buyers find necessary.

This fundamental shift in the state's regulatory structure would bypass=20
procedures that currently protect the interests of consumers.

The proposed agreement between the state Public Utilities Commission and th=
e=20
state Department of Water Resources is designed to guarantee that consumers=
=20
pay enough to cover the purchase by the state of electricity for the 27=20
million people served by three financially troubled utilities.

Consumer payments will be used to repay bonds the state plans to float late=
r=20
this year. The bonds will be used to reimburse the state treasury for money=
=20
spent on electricity. The PUC is expected to formally ratify the agreement=
=20
Aug. 23.

A spokesman for the water department said that a historic rate increase in=
=20
March is expected to cover all of the agency's costs and that no new hikes=
=20
will be necessary.

But under the terms of the proposed agreement, if that expectation proves=
=20
incorrect and future hikes are needed, the PUC promises to adjust electrici=
ty=20
rates to meet the department's need for revenue within 90 days, or 30 days =
in=20
emergency situations.

""The ruling gives carte blanche to [the department] to do whatever they wan=
t=20
to do,"" said Richard Bilas, a PUC member appointed by former Gov. Pete=20
Wilson. ""We don't have much control over them. I am uncomfortable with it.""

If approved, the agreement would shift the oversight of electricity rates=
=20
from the PUC, an independent regulatory body whose members are appointed by=
=20
the governor, to a state administrative agency that is under the governor's=
=20
direct control.

S. David Freeman, Gov. Gray Davis' chief energy advisor, said the agreement=
=20
would essentially transform the state water department into ""the equivalent=
=20
of a municipal utility"" that has sole discretion to raise revenue from its=
=20
customers.

The PUC would only have the authority to ""make sure that our math is OK, an=
d=20
we haven't gone out and bought the Brooklyn Bridge,"" Freeman said.

Already, however, the state's judgment in buying power has been questioned.=
=20
The Department of Water Resources has signed long-term contracts designed t=
o=20
ensure stable supplies. But critics have charged that those contracts have=
=20
locked the state into prices that are too high. Indeed, because of cool=20
weather and reduced demand by consumers, the state--at least temporarily--i=
s=20
buying more power than California needs and has begun reselling some of it=
=20
for considerably less than it costs.

In another energy-related development, a top executive of Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison Co., one of the three utilities that has been flirting with=20
insolvency, criticized as inadequate a state Senate bailout bill.

The bill is a thoroughly rewritten version of a highly publicized deal Davi=
s=20
and Edison officials fashioned in April to restore the company's financial=
=20
health. That deal called for the state to buy the utility's transmission=20
lines for $2.76 billion.

At a hearing of the Senate Energy Committee, Bob Foster, an Edison vice=20
president, testified that the Senate version, which is expected to be voted=
=20
on this week, would leave Edison $1 billion short of meeting its financial=
=20
needs.

The problems of Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas &=20
Electric Co. triggered the need for the deal between the PUC and the water=
=20
department. That agreement was hammered out in high-pressure negotiations=
=20
that involved dozens of state officials and bonding experts. It is viewed b=
y=20
state officials and bond analysts as critical to the sale this summer of th=
e=20
$13.4-billion bond issue.

But Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consume=
r=20
Rights in Santa Monica, said the agreement would strip away the PUC's=20
constitutional obligation to protect consumers from unreasonable rate hikes=
.

""This is a power play by the Davis administration, the energy companies and=
=20
Wall Street to eliminate any public scrutiny over their conduct and the pri=
ce=20
of electricity for the next 10 to 15 years,"" he said.

The agreement is the latest step in implementing emergency legislation pass=
ed=20
this year to allow the water department to buy power. The agency stepped in=
to=20
the market after the three utilities said that rates frozen under the state=
's=20
deregulation plan were preventing them from recovering their costs and were=
=20
threatening their solvency.

Assembly Bill 1X, signed into law by Davis in February, provided that the=
=20
water department would be able to recover its costs and directed the PUC to=
=20
implement an agreement to accomplish that.

The agreement also would provide assurance to Wall Street that electric rat=
es=20
would provide a reliable flow of funds that could be used to pay off the=20
bonds. The state hopes to use the bonds to create a revolving fund that wou=
ld=20
pay for $8 billion in current and future power costs.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the rate agreement ""must be adopted so=
=20
that the general fund can be repaid, and to protect the state's fiscal=20
solvency. . . . This agreement provides the assurance that, for the term of=
=20
the bonds, the law will be honored so that bonds can be sold and bondholder=
s=20
repaid.""

Equally important is the water department's projection of how much revenue=
=20
the agency needs for everything from spot market power purchases and the co=
st=20
of long-term contracts to administrative costs and debt service. That=20
detailed assessment will indicate whether the increase approved in March--a=
n=20
average hike of 3 cents per kilowatt/hour--will be enough to cover the=20
department's costs for the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2002. Officials =
at=20
the PUC and the department said the projection could be submitted as soon a=
s=20
Friday.

""We do not anticipate that [the department] will be seeking any further=20
increase beyond the increase announced by the PUC last spring,"" said=20
department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. ""We're well within the 3-cent increase.=
""

The department's statement of its revenue needs has ramifications not only=
=20
for consumers, but also for utilities. Utility officials fear that their ow=
n=20
costs might not be covered after the department takes its share of the=20
revenue from monthly bills.

PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the company's lawyers are assessing the propose=
d=20
agreement but would have no comment on it until they can see the water=20
department's revenue requirement. He said the company hopes there will be=
=20
enough left ""to ensure our customers are treated fairly"" and to cover the=
=20
company's costs, including payments for the power it produces and purchases=
=20
through contracts.

Edison officials said they would not comment until they received more=20
information.

The proposed agreement, though not unanticipated, would reduce the role of=

the PUC in one of the most pivotal chapters of the energy crisis.

Normally, the PUC holds hearings and conducts ""prudency"" reviews before=20
making decisions on rate increases, but the water department would not be=
=20
subject to the same procedures.

""It will not be a review where we say you were imprudent, you goofed up and=
=20
will have to eat the cost, or you badly negotiated these contracts,"" said=
=20
Commissioner Jeff Brown, who was part of the negotiations.

Brown said the two agencies had differences over issues such as whether the=
=20
water department's administrative costs should be covered by the rate=20
agreement and the extent of the PUC's review. But he said the overriding=20
concern was that the state's bond sale not be delayed or otherwise=20
jeopardized by uncertainty about the water department's ability to meet its=
=20
financial obligations.

""I wish we were not in this situation,"" he said. ""But when we started doing=
=20
purchases, the state was the only credit-worthy entity. We're swimming=20
upstream.""

Commissioner Bilas said that although the bond sale is highly important, he=
=20
is concerned that the water department will not be subject to governmental=
=20
checks and balances because the department head reports directly to Davis.

""If the governor believes the director of [the department] is doing a bad=
=20
job, he can be removed,"" Bilas said. ""But it is a matter of how much faith=
=20
you have in individuals rather than faith in a system.""

Commissioner Carl Wood, one of Davis' three appointees on the five-member=
=20
commission, pointed out that the PUC was set up to protect the interests of=
=20
the customers of private utility companies with a monopoly. ""When a public=
=20
agency takes over [the purchase of power], things like a prudency review do=
=20
not have the same meaning,"" he said.

PUC President Loretta Lynch, who published the proposed agreement and=20
solicited comment on it, could not be reached Wednesday.

Her legal advisor, Geoff Dryvynsyde, said the commission has to make a publ=
ic=20
policy choice that weighs the need to sell the bonds against its own=20
authority to set rates.

""There is lots to balance here,"" he said. ""A really important consideration=
=20
is the bond deal, and the rate agreement is important to getting that done.=

The lights have stayed on this summer, but California residents are more=20
anxious than ever about the state's energy crunch, according to a survey=20
released today.=20
""People are still very worried,"" said Marc Baldassare, who directed the pol=
l=20
for the Public Policy Institute of California. ""They're not convinced we're=
=20
totally out of danger.""=20
While a record number of residents list electricity prices as the state's t=
op=20
problem, Gov. Gray Davis seems to be getting some credit for improving a ba=
d=20
situation.=20
The poll found only 39 percent of those surveyed approve of the way Davis i=
s=20
dealing with the power problems, but that's a steady increase from the 29=
=20
percent mark he had in a similar survey two months ago.=20
""As time goes by without any significant new problems, people realize that =
an=20
effort has been made,"" Baldassare said. ""If things aren't normal, they don'=
t=20
seem to be getting any worse.""=20
More than half those surveyed list electricity prices as the state's top=20
concern, with all other worries paling by comparison. Education, the leadin=
g=20
issue just last year, was listed as the state's most important issue by onl=
y=20
9 percent of those surveyed, with jobs and the economy third with 5 percent=
.=20
""People need to realize that there's not an endless supply of power and oil=
,=20
"" said Austin Eddy of San Francisco, one of those surveyed. ""Maybe these=20
problems can serve as a wake-up call.""=20
The poll of 2,007 Californians, conducted July 1 to July 10, has a margin o=
f=20
error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.=20
The overall news for the governor in the survey isn't good despite the uptu=
rn=20
in numbers for his attempt to ease the power crunch. Davis is still getting=
=20
his share of blame, and it is showing in his approval ratings. Only 44=20
percent like the job he is doing as governor, while 45 percent are unhappy=
=20
with his performance. That's down slightly from his 46 percent approval=20
rating in May and far below the 63 percent mark Davis had in a January=20
survey.=20
APPORTIONING THE BLAME
Those polled still give utility companies, such as Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co., and former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who approved utility=
=20
deregulation much of the blame for the current crisis, but they are=20
increasingly calling Davis and the current Legislature to account. The=20
percentage of people who blame Davis for the power problems jumped from 10=
=20
percent in May to 16 percent in the new survey.=20
""People are less likely to look in the past for blame and more willing to=
=20
look at the current situation,"" Baldassare said. ""They are moving toward=20
blaming the people in charge now.""=20
But Davis seems to be winning the high-stakes public relations battle he's=
=20
having with President Bush over the energy crisis. Bush saw his approval=20
rating in the state skid from 57 percent in May to 47 percent today while t=
he=20
proportion of people who disapprove of the way he's handled the power woes=
=20
jumped from 56 percent to 63 percent.=20
When asked who is more to blame for the state's electricity problems, 26=20
percent of those surveyed chose Davis to 12 percent who chose Bush.=20
But when asked who is providing better solutions to the problem, 34 percent=
=20
chose the governor compared with 8 percent who give Bush the nod.=20
BAD MARKS FOR BUSH
""The energy problem has hurt Bush,"" Baldassare said. ""Very few people think=
=20
he's come up with good solutions.""=20
Much of Bush's proposed energy plan runs contrary to California's=20
preferences. The president's program backs oil drilling in environmentally=
=20
sensitive areas, calls for the possibility of more nuclear plants and oppos=
es=20
oil price controls.=20
""I don't think Bush has his priorities straight,"" Eddy said. ""He's not=20
concerned about finding alternative ways of doing things and changing the w=
ay=20
things are done.""=20
The new poll shows 56 percent of those surveyed favoring price controls, 57=
=20
percent opposed to nuclear power plants in their region and 71 percent=20
against oil exploration in federally protected areas.=20
More than two-thirds of those surveyed, including half the Republicans,=20
believe that the environment must be protected, even if it means higher=20
prices for gas and electricity.=20
""Bush has talked about the need to increase the energy supply, but his idea=
s=20
have not gained any traction in California,"" Baldassare said. ""A lot of=20
people here oppose a trade-off with energy and the environment.""=20

Crawford's payoff: $6.09, less than the average residential rebate of $10.7=

""I hear all these stories about all these heroic things people did,"" Crawfo=

If only it were that easy. Nearly a third of PG&E customers have opened the=

But that is of little consequence to the 510,000 PG&E residential customers=

Sacramento -- Two sharply contrasting plans to prevent debt-ridden Southern=
=20
California Edison from being dragged into bankruptcy cleared a key Assembly=
=20
committee last night, but a third measure stalled in the Senate.=20
The first bill approved by the Assembly Energy Cost and Availability=20
Committee calls for the state to purchase Edison's transmission lines for=
=20
$2.4 billion as a way to help the utility out of its estimated $3.5 billion=
=20
in debt.=20
The plan drew criticism from business and consumer groups, and many lawmake=
rs=20
who said other aspects of the rescue plan are too complicated wondered open=
ly=20
if it wouldn't be better to let the utility to go bankrupt.=20
But Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, an author of the bill, said=
=20
before the 11-to-9 vote that lawmakers have to work with legislation that i=
s=20
complicated and not entirely pleasing.=20
""If this was easy, or if this was simple, we wouldn't call it a crisis,"" he=
=20
said. ""This is far beyond a problem or a policy that we can debate and as a=
=20
consequence the solutions are neither simple or easy.""=20
After a day of furious activity, the close vote -- with some Democrats=20
joining Republicans in opposition -- may spell trouble when it reaches the=
=20
floor of the Assembly.=20
The Assembly Appropriations Committee approved the plan 12 to 6 late last=
=20
night, setting up a floor vote for today.=20
The second plan that cleared the Assembly committee would be a ""straight=20
bailout,"" said its author, Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles. It was=20
approved 12 to 3. The Appropriations Committee did not take up Wright's bil=

The state would back $3.5 billion in bonds issued by the utility and then b=
e=20
repaid through a $2-a-month charge for Edison ratepayers.=20
The Edison deal is considered a linchpin to getting the state out of the=20
power-buying business, something that is costing taxpayers upward of $50=20
million a day. If Edison joins Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in Bankruptcy=
=20
Court, there is no clear way out of the electricity-buying business for the=
=20
state.=20
Gov. Gray Davis has said that he hopes any rescue plan for Edison would be=
=20
used as a model for PG&E to get out of court and back into the power-buying=
=20
business.=20
Also, a Senate committee defeated another proposal after the company said i=
t=20
would not work. The bill would let the utility issue $2.5 billion in revenu=
e=20
bonds, to be repaid by ratepayers.=20
The Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee's 4-to-3 vote came=
=20
as lawmakers struggle to approve some kind of rescue plan before the end of=
=20
the week, when they are scheduled to start a monthlong recess. The bill=20
needed five votes to pass and the chairwoman of the panel said another vote=
=20
would be taken today.=20
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, who abstained from voting in the=20
committee, said the bill was defeated because senators weren't prepared to=
=20
send it to the floor yet.=20
""The bill does not have broad support in the Democratic caucus,"" said Speie=
r,=20
who opposes the bill.=20
Edison objects to the bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, because it=20
contains no way for the company to pay back the other $1 billion it owes=20
generators. Bob Foster, an Edison vice president, said the goal of a rescue=
=20
plan is to remove the state from the electricity business and restore the=
=20
utility to creditworthiness.=20
""This bill can't do that,"" he said in a Senate hearing.=20
Sher's proposal would also give the state a five-year option to purchase th=
e=20

Business groups and consumer organizations blasted the measure.=20

Unseasonably cool weather has turned the California power crisis on its hea=

=20
to sell excess power at a loss.=20
In some cases, traders say, energy bought at an average of $138 per megawat=
t=20

State officials acknowledged selling excess power over the past week, but=

operation,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water=20
Resources, which is in charge of buying power for three financially ailing=

utilities. ""It's better than doing nothing with surplus power.""=20
The agency has spent the past few months arming the state with long-term=20
energy contracts while weaning itself away from buying high-priced power on=
=20
the last-minute electricity market.=20
Those contracts, along with the temperate weather and a boost in energy=20
conservation, mean there's suddenly more power than Californians can use.=

The investigative arm of Congress demanded Wednesday that Vice President Di=
ck=20
Cheney identify all the industry leaders who helped formulate the Bush=20
administration's energy policy. Refusal could lead to a court fight.=20
The White House, which is reviewing the request, said it would work with th=
e=20
General Accounting Office to resolve the issue.=20
The GAO letter follows repeated refusals by the vice president's office to=
=20
provide names and titles of participants who met with the energy task force=
=20
chaired by Cheney.=20
Under the law, the GAO could sue if the Bush administration fails to supply=
=20
the data within 20 days.=20
This is the first demand letter ever issued by the GAO to the vice presiden=
t=20
of the United States, said Democratic Reps. John Dingell and Henry Waxman,=
=20
who directed the agency to review the task force's work nearly three months=
=20
ago.=20
The vice president's lawyer has told the GAO there were nine meetings of th=
e=20
task force and that staffers also met with many people to gather informatio=
n.=20
The result was an energy policy, announced May 17, that is aimed at=20
increasing the nation's supply of energy. It includes expanded oil and gas=
=20
drilling on public land and a rejuvenated nuclear power system.=20
White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said the letter is under review, and ""w=
e=20
will continue to work with the GAO to resolve this issue.""=20
The vice president's office ""has continued on its course of secrecy and=20
obstinance,"" Dingell said in a statement.=20
""The White House should simply try telling the truth ... and stop hiding=20
information that Congress and the public have a right to see,"" said Waxman.=
=20
A top Cheney aide, Mary Matalin, said Waxman and Dingell should ""stop wasti=
ng=20
taxpayers' money"" with their confrontation with the vice president. ""If the=
y=20

The White House's position is that the GAO is entitled to information on th=

Poll: Legislators, Davis blamed more than sellers=20
Posted at 10:08 p.m. PDT Wednesday, July 18, 2001=20
BY STEVE=20
JOHNSON=20
Mercury News=20

Despite months of loudly accusing electricity suppliers of price gouging an=
d=20
leaving the state in a terrible mess, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leade=
rs=20
haven't convinced most Californians, a new poll suggests.=20
When the Public Policy Institute of California asked 2,007 adults this mont=
h=20
who was mostly responsible for the energy crisis, Davis and lawmakers were=
=20
blamed more than private power sellers.=20
Moreover, most of those surveyed said they preferred having businesses in=
=20
charge of producing and distributing electricity in California and that it=
=20
would be a bad idea for state government to take over that role.=20
``It means that the efforts to single out the power generators has really n=
ot=20
been very effective on the part of the governor or the Legislature,'' said=
=20
Mark Baldassare, who directed the non-profit research group's poll released=
=20
today. ``Californians look to a whole group of actors in this crisis as=20
playing major parts in the problem.''=20
The poll was conducted before the Mercury News reported Wednesday that the=
=20
state was selling costly surplus power at bargain prices, a move that had o=
ne=20
lawmaker calling for more details from the governor. It was one of a number=
=20
of recent instances in which state officials had to defend their own energy=
=20
dealings. And as they have done in the past, they responded by blaming=20
generators for most of the state's problems.=20
But today's poll heartened some electricity suppliers, who say they are tir=
ed=20
of the barrage of price-gouging allegations being leveled at them.=20
``Wow, maybe the public understands that this problem is a lot more complex=
,=20
which is what we've been saying all along,'' said Patrick Dorinson, of Mira=
nt=20
Corp., which has several major power plants in the Bay Area and is among th=
e=20
nation's biggest electricity suppliers. ``Maybe it also indicates that the=
=20
public is getting tired of the blame game.''=20
But some experts said the poll may simply underscore a misunderstanding abo=
ut=20
the difference between utilities and other electricity sellers.=20
Asked who ``is most to blame for the current electricity situation in=20
California,'' 22 percent picked the former governor and Legislature, 16=20
percent picked the current governor and Legislature, and 10 percent listed=
=20
power generators.=20
However, electric utilities companies were picked by 23 percent, even thoug=
h=20
they've given up much of their electricity-producing responsibilities to=20
private firms under the state's 1996 energy deregulation law.=20
Davis and other state officials have repeatedly accused private electricity=
=20
sellers of overcharging the state and helping drive Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
Co. into bankruptcy. Still, ``most consumers don't know the difference''=20
between utilities and the firms that supply power to the utilities, said=20
Steve Maviglio, Davis' chief spokesman.=20
Even some experts hired by the energy industry say it's easy for the public=
=20
to be confused.=20
The way power is bought and sold in this deregulated energy marketplace=20
probably mystifies many, said Marty Wilson, who has polled about 6,000=20
Californians this year for Reliant Energy of Houston.=20
Nevertheless, Wilson added that his polling also finds little support for t=
he=20
notion that power suppliers are primarily to blame. About 40 percent of tho=
se=20
he has questioned attribute the state's energy problems to the 1996 law. By=
=20
contrast, the percent of people who blamed private power suppliers was less=
=20
than half that, he said, adding, ``they clearly see this as a failure of=20
government.''=20
Still, Davis isn't likely to ease up on his criticism of private power=20
suppliers. ``The governor will continue to point the finger at whoever he=
=20
sees as causing prices to rise,'' Maviglio said, ``and the No. 1 villain is=
=20
generators.''=20
S. David Freeman, Davis' chief energy adviser, reiterated that point during=
 a=20
meeting Wednesday with the Mercury News editorial board. He defended the=20
state's attacks on energy companies and credited the relentless pressure fo=
r=20
forcing federal regulators recently to consider ordering significant refund=
s=20
from the firms.=20
``We did some things right, and one of them was calling attention to the fa=
ct=20
that we were being robbed,'' Freeman said.=20
Consumers were given the least amount of blame for the state's energy=20
problems in the Public Policy Institute survey.=20
More than four out of five -- 81 percent -- said they were closely watching=
=20
news reports about the energy crisis, and 56 percent said the biggest singl=
e=20
issue facing California was the price and availability of electricity. That=
=20
was the first time in the survey's three-year history that a majority of=20
respondents had named the same issue as the most important problem.=20
Most of those questioned also said they were trying hard to conserve. ``Six=
=20
in 10 residents say they have done `a lot'' to reduce their use of=20
electricity and appliances at home during peak hours,'' the survey found.=
=20
Belief in the importance of conservation was equally strong among Democrats=
=20
and Republicans. But the survey found significant differences among ethnic=
=20
and income groups.=20
``Public support for conservation is strongest among younger, less educated=
=20
and lower-income residents,'' it concluded. Moreover, by a ratio of 25=20
percent to 16 percent, it said, ``Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic=
=20

problems.''=20

Consumers to bear costs of state's power purchases=20
Posted at 10:30 p.m. PDT Wednesday, July 18, 2001=20
BY MICHAEL BAZELEY=20

Mercury News=20


State energy regulators have reluctantly signed away one of their most=20
fundamental consumer protection roles: the right to question and reject=20
requests for higher power rates.=20
Under a proposed rate agreement with the state Department of Water Resource=
s=20
released Wednesday, the Public Utilities Commission promises to pass all th=
e=20
state's power-buying costs directly to consumers.=20
Unlike its relationship with utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric, the=
=20
utilities commission will not be able to audit the department's books or=20
question its expenses. And it will have just 90 days to raise rates if the=
=20
state concludes it needs more money.=20
``Previously, we had discretion to raise rates or not raise rates,'' said=
=20
Commissioner Jeff Brown. ``Here, we're in a situation where it's a bill --=
=20
pay it.''=20
The rate agreement, which the commission is expected to approve next month,=
=20
marks a sea change for the agency.=20
The commission has acted as a check against exorbitant energy rates by=20
reviewing utility costs and setting rates it deemed reasonable.=20
But now the state has stepped into the power-buying business, purchasing a=
=20
third or more of the energy used statewide. The state wants to finance its=
=20
costs with $13.4 billion in bonds but says it needs to guarantee investors=
=20
that consumers will repay them.=20
The agreement comes as no surprise. A state law passed in January says the=
=20
commission must set rates to cover the water resources agency's bills.=20
Nonetheless, some consumer groups are fuming.=20
``It is effectively a blank check for the state,'' said Doug Heller, of the=
=20
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``Any costs the state incurs -=
-=20
whether it be consultants for Gray Davis or trips to Texas -- anything they=
=20
pass on is considered just and reasonable. That's deregulation on crack.''=
=20
Under the 17-page agreement, the Department of Water Resources will=20
periodically send a ``revenue requirement'' to state utilities regulators.=
=20
The regulators will use the document to set rates within the 90-day time=20
frame.=20
If the department starts to run short of cash -- because of dramatic spikes=
=20
in the price of power, for instance -- the commission could be forced to=20
adjust rates within 30 days.=20
The commission would have minimal discretion to challenge the state's reven=
ue=20
requests, according to the agreement, beyond pointing out ``arithmetic=20
error'' or costs not related to paying off the bonds or buying power.=20
State officials said they cannot sell the bonds if investors believe the=20
commission might reject any of the state's power-buying costs.=20
At the same time, they said, officials are scrutinizing every contract they=
=20
negotiate with power generators to make sure consumers are getting the best=
=20
deal.=20
``Every contract is critiqued within our department,'' said Oscar Hidalgo,=
=20
spokesman for the water resources department. ``And a lot of the=20
administrative costs are handled the same way.''=20
Under the new arrangement, utilities would still have to justify their cost=
s=20
when asking for a rate increase, but the state would not.=20
Whether rates will need to go up again soon is not clear. The commission ha=
s=20
already voted in two big rate increases this year, one in January and anoth=
er=20
in March. The state is expected to give the commission its latest revenue=
=20
requirement Friday. State officials say that, with falling power prices, th=
ey=20
do not see a need for higher rates.=20

Conservation is cutting edge of power crisis=20
July 19, 2001=20
By Jonathan Lansner
The Orange County Register=20
The Edison bill has arrived. It was almost as exciting a mailbox event as t=
he=20
seemingly regular arrival of a sweepstakes envelope.=20
Best of all, the bill said, ""You won!"" Well, it really didn't say that. But=
=20
it might as well have.=20
The family's electric bill did note that we sliced our electricity use by a=
=20
third from a year ago. Whoopee!=20
Because we conserved so well, we got a 16-buck rebate. Now, for full=20
disclosure, we sort of cheated. Thanks to a remodeling job in progress, we=
=20
have no air conditioner to abuse. But we weren't the only ones cashing in o=
n=20
conservation, so to speak.=20
According to Edison, 31percent of its residential customers in June took th=
e=20
conservation bait: Cut electricity usage by 20 percent, get a state-funded =
20=20
percent rebate.=20
For the month, 287,224 families in these parts got $2.5 million in rebates =
-=20
or nearly nine bucks a household. That's state taxpayer money at work.=20
Now that sum's no grand windfall. Nor does it fully negate the year's rate=
=20
hikes. But it generates spendable cash. And it's an important conservation=
=20
message.=20
Those 287,224 families earning a June rebate saved what seems at first glan=
ce=20
to be a smidgen of the state's monthly energy usage. You know, $2.5million=
=20
looks like pocket change when headlines talk of billion-dollar deals and/or=
=20
overcharges.=20
However, consider this math: That $2.5million would buy roughly 24,000=20
megawatts of electricity, using Edison's average cost of power this year.=
=20
Believe it or not, 24,000 megawatts is more than a half-day of typical=20
statewide use. Not bad conservation by customers of just one of three major=
=20
utilities in the state.=20
Then roughly double that figure because the state handed out nearly $3milli=
on=20
in June rebates to commercial users for their savings.=20
You know, this conservation thing is more than a sound bite. One reason the=
=20
lights have stayed on this summer in California to date is that demand is=
=20
down by as much as 12 percent.=20
Sure, the weather's unseasonably pleasant, keeping many air conditioners of=
f.=20
And a painful technology slump shuttered some energy-guzzling factories.=20
Nevertheless, the populace also is well aware of the higher energy costs.=
=20
Average Joes and Janes appear very willing to play the money-saving game.=
=20
Compact fluorescent light bulbs, ceiling or attic fans, and double-pane gla=
ss=20
aren't just home-improvement hype.=20
Forget politics. Forget finger-pointing. Please remember basic economics.=
=20
Price motivates consumers to action. Discounts typically lure crowds.=20
Surcharges usually scare off buyers.=20
The fact that nearly one-third of Edison's residential customers slashed=20
energy use in the face of nearly 40 percent rate hikes and a 20 percent=20
rebate carrot clearly proves that point.=20
Whine all you want about what caused the energy mess. Blame the incompetent=
=20
Sacramento crowd. Blame the bungling utilities. Blame the shady out-of town=
=20
generators. Heck, blame L.A.'s stealthy Department of Water and Power.=20
Nevertheless, when you talk solutions, conservation is the most logical=20
choice.=20

California's New Problem: Sudden Surplus of Energy=20
By JAMES STERNGOLD=20

The New York Times=20

c. 2001 New York Times Company=20
LOS ANGELES, July 18 -- After months of warnings about power shortages and=
=20
forced blackouts, an unusually cool July and surprisingly effective=20
conservation efforts have put California in a stunning position: it has so=
=20
much electricity on its hands that it is selling its surplus into a glutted=
=20
market.=20
In fact, state officials said today, after spending much of the winter and=
=20
spring scrambling to line up new supplies of electricity at a cost of tens =
of=20
billions of dollars, the agency that is in charge of buying power has=20
actually been selling some back at a loss this week.=20
Oscar Hidalgo, the spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, which=
=20
became the state's main buyer of power after soaring wholesale prices pushe=
d=20
private utilities toward bankruptcy this year, would not provide exact=20
figures on how much the state was selling or how much money it was losing.=
=20
But the department has said it was paying on average $133 per megawatt-hour=
=20
this month, much of which it is obliged to buy whether it needs it or not,=
=20
under long-term contracts signed in recent months. By contrast, officials=
=20
say, the department at times has sold some of that power back into the mark=
et=20
at prices as low as $15 per megawatt-hour.=20
Mr. Hidalgo insisted that the surplus power could quickly vanish if=20
temperatures soar as expected in August.=20
Some consumer groups, which have bitterly criticized the state's energy=20
policies in the crisis, seized on the sales as evidence of what they said w=
as=20
a poorly thought-out plan that had left the state at the mercy of a mercile=
ss=20
market.=20
''This state agency has no expertise in trading,'' said Harvey Rosenfield, =
an=20
official at the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ''It is=20
amateurish at best and sometimes incompetent, negotiating with a bunch of=
=20
M.B.A.'s whose goal is to soak California. The state was panicked into=20
leaping into this business, and it is being outwitted.''=20
But a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis defended the state's purchases, saying=
=20
its response to an emergency has produced greater reliability and, in the=
=20
long term, a greater supply of power.=20
''Like we said all along, we're doing everything within our power to contro=
l=20
the situation and stabilize things,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's=
=20
spokesman. ''But the weather is not within our control. When the utilities=
=20
were in this business, they ran into this situation routinely.''=20
On Monday, for example, the high temperature in San Diego was 70 degrees,=
=20
compared with an average of 77 degrees. In San Francisco, the high was 66,=
=20
compared with an average of 72, and in Fresno it was 87, down from the=20
average of 99. That meant that air-conditioners across the state were turne=
d=20
down.=20
But officials said that the weather was not the only factor in relieving th=
e=20
sense of crisis in California and that the state's conservation program had=
=20
produced a significant reduction in demand.=20
The state energy commission has said that total demand was down 12 percent=
=20
this June from June 2000, adjusted for the weather and economic growth.=20
The conservation program provides rebates for buying certain energy-efficie=
nt=20
appliances and special discounts for large consumers that reduce their powe=
r=20
needs sharply from previous years.=20
In addition, state and federal office buildings have instituted conservatio=
n=20
measures, including turning off lights and computers at night and adjusting=
=20
thermostats.=20
Also, big rate increases, of as much as 40 percent in certain instances,=20
kicked in this June, encouraging consumers to cut electricity use further.=
=20
Some experts have warned that while a sense of crisis has helped produce th=
e=20
big reductions in demand, as soon as people feel that the emergency has=20
passed at least some will return to their old ways and demand may rise agai=
n.=20
According to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the=
=20
power system, peak demand today was expected to be 32,651 megawatts, and th=
e=20
available supply was slightly above 40,000 megawatts.=20
In January, the state suffered several power emergencies in which it was=20
forced to pay more than $1,000 a megawatt at times of critical shortages.=
=20
But even with those purchases, utilities were forced to cut power in some=
=20
places when the demand exceeded the supply. The last time the state had to=
=20
resort to blackouts was on May 8.=20
After the emergencies in the winter, the state frantically lined up power=
=20
purchases on contracts ranging from a few months to 10 years and more.=20
The state tried to put together a diverse portfolio of contracts that would=
=20
ease the shortages but not lock the government into paying too much if pric=
es=20
declined in the future. Energy experts expected some declines in prices but=
=20
not this quickly.=20
The Department of Water Resources paid an average of $243 per megawatt in=
=20
May, but the price has now dropped to $133 per megawatt on average this=20
month, some of that in the form of spot purchases and some under the=20
long-term contracts. Mr. Hidalgo said the department's sales of power back =
to=20
the market had been at $15 to $30 per megawatt.=20
Some energy traders said the state was just paying the price any market=20
participant must accept.=20
''They're not doing anything imprudent,'' said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesma=
n=20
for the Mirant Corporation, a large power generator and trader. ''They're=
=20
just finding out how the markets work. Everything is built on forecasting,=
=20
and sometimes the forecasts are wrong.''=20
Mr. Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said the state's planning was built=
=20
on forecasts of a harsher summer and less conservation. ''The forecasts hav=
e=20
turned out to be far more conservative than the reality,'' he said.=20
Mr. Rosenfield countered: ''We've been outwitted. They goofed, and it looks=
=20
like taxpayer money is being thrown down the toilet.''=20
In May, the amount of power the state needed to buy on the so-called spot=
=20
market, which means purchases in which the electricity would be supplied=20
immediately, accounted for close to 45 percent of the total purchases.=20
Typically, longer-term contracts are at fixed prices, while spot purchases=
=20
can be enormously volatile.=20
But because of the reduced demand in July, spot purchases have made up just=
 5=20
percent or so of the Department of Water Resource's total purchases, and at=
=20
the times of lowest demand, like this week, officials have decided to get=
=20
what they can by reselling excess power.=20
''This is a normal business practice,'' Mr. Hidalgo said. ''We can buy powe=
r=20
and we can sell power. I don't think anyone would have predicted that we=20
would have found ourselves in this position in July. But we're not out of t=
he=20
woods. August could be raging hot.''=20

Oscar -- At this point, FERC does not have jurisdiction over coops and munis (most public power entities are non-jurisdictional) and cannot ""force"" them to join RTOs.  TVA does not have to join an RTO either.  However, FERC does have some carrots and sticks that it can use, for example, a public that does not join an RTO could be precluded from using the jurisdictional (actually, the rest) of the transmission system.  Therefore, many will probably join just as they have currently filed ""reciprocity"" tariffs at FERC in order to have the advantages of using the system.  EK Coop currently has a reciprocity tariff on file with FERC, so would probably have to withdraw it at some point if it decides not to join an RTO.

Also, requirements to make publics join RTOs are in the current legislative proposals before Congress.  I am not sure that any will actually pass; however, Enron is working on this too.

Other questions are answered below.

Christi/Mike:

In a meeting yesterday with East Kentucky Power Cooperative, they indicated that they will be joining a RTG to be headed by TVA which will essentially become and RTO for Public Power entities.  We have also heard indirectly, that EK will make some type of filing/release that they are non-jurisdictional and therefore not required to join any 
RTO.

I would like your comments on whether FERC can force EK into the MISO or Alliance.

EK has mostly 161 kv line with some 345kv and is right in the middle of the North to South transfer that takes place between the Midwest and TVA.

Key questions:

1.  Can EK opt out of the process....even if they have a large transmission system
[Nicolay, Christi L.]   Currently, yes, see above for sticks.

2.  Will a RTG for public power be encouraged/discouraged.  If its discouraged by FERC, can FERC shut it down?
[Nicolay, Christi L.]  FERC cannot actually tell publics that they cannot be an RTG; however, FERC has the same sticks.  If legislatively or otherwise (through DOE) TVA ends up joining an RTO, these others in the vicinity of TVA may well follow.

3.  Where in the process is the Public Power RTG?
[Nicolay, Christi L.]  I am not familiar with this RTG (I don't think they have filed anything at FERC and they do not have to.)  JOE C.- have you heard anything?

any other comments would be helpful.


thanks

Companies: BG Group Buys Assets in India From Enron --- U.K. Company Extends Reach at a Bargain Price

LONDON -- BG Group PLC extended its reach in the Indian subcontinent and expanded its exploration and production portfolio with the purchase of the offshore Indian assets of U.S. energy group Enron Corp. for $388 million (422 million euros). 
Analysts applauded the purchase by the U.K. oil and gas company, saying it is acquiring some promising assets inexpensively. The price works out to less than $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent, given the proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. ""We value other Indian oil and gas reserves at $2.90 (assuming an oil price of $18), so BG appears to have paid a good price,"" said ABN Amro in a research note.
A Bombay-based energy analyst reckoned Enron ""probably undersold,"" noting that earlier this year Indian state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., a partner of Enron's Indian unit, had its $400 million offer for the assets rejected. 
Enron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in India, and is attempting to exit the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's largest private power plant, in which it has a 65% controlling stake. 
The Indian unit's assets comprise a 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, and a 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration license in the Gulf of Cambay off western India. The Enron unit is the designated operator of these developments. 
Equity production from the fields amounts to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, representing about 6% to 7% of BG's total output. For the year ended March 31, Enron's Indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $60 million on revenue of $160 million. 
The acquisition complements BG's fledgling refining and marketing interests in India, which include holdings in western Indian distributors Gujarat Gas Co. (65%) and Mahanagar Gas (50%). It is also the driving force behind a project to pipe liquefied natural gas from Iran to tap India's growing appetite for gas.

BG to Buy Enron Assets Offshore India 
British oil and natural-gas company BG Group agreed to acquire the offshore Indian assets of U.S. energy company Enron for $388 million. The purchase of Enron Oil & Gas India, with proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent, is valued at about $2.30 a barrel, a bargain by international standards, analysts said. Enron has had mixed success as an integrated energy company in India, and is attempting to unwind its 65% stake in Dabhol Power, India's largest private-sector power plant.

The BG Group of Britain agreed to buy the oil and natural gas fields of Enron in India for $388 million. The operations include a 30 percent stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukhta oil and gas fields, plus 63 percent of an untapped deposit on the country's west coast. BG said the assets held more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas. They do not include Enron's Dabhol Power project, which has been entangled in a nine-month payment dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Enron is looking to sell its 64 percent stake in the project for $1.2 billion to cover the cost of its investment. Tata Power and BSES, both of India, have indicated an interest, people close to the talks said. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK - BG to expand assets in India.

BG, the gas and oil group, has stepped up its efforts to develop India into one of its core markets with the $388m ( #262m) purchase of assets owned by Enron, the US energy and trading group. 
The deal is the latest sign of Enron's retreat from the region, and comes as the group is separately attempting to withdraw from the $2.8bn Dabhol power plant following a payment dispute with Maharashtra state.
BG is placing particular emphasis on developing markets. 
It has operated in India for 10 years but has so far concentrated on gas distribution through a 65 per cent interest in Gujarat Gas Company and a joint venture with the Gas Authority of India in Mumbai. 
David McManus, BG executive vice-president responsible for eastern hemisphere business, said the transaction would give it the opportunity to develop the Indian gas market. The company has a view to creating demand for imported liquefied natural gas through BG's planned Pipavav LNG terminal in Gujarat. 
""India has the second fastest-growing gas market after China and we see it as a core place to use our expertise,"" he said. 
The agreement is subject to confirmation from Enron's partners that BG will be able to take over operating the fields, and consent from the Indian government. 
Analysts said the acquisition was a logical next step for BG and appeared good value against market expectations of a $600m price for the assets. 
Iain Reid of UBS Warburg said: ""Either BG are extremely good negotiators or there is an element of risk attached to the speed at which production can be increased.""

Abreast of the Market
Cisco, Extreme Networks Surge As Technology Stocks Lead Rally
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- As U.S. stocks staged their biggest rally since last spring, technology stocks were leaders on hopes that the extended period of fundamental deterioration might have begun to draw to a close. 
Cisco Systems, which traded at a 52-week low just last week amid dismal expectations for sales and earnings, finished $2.47, or 22%, higher at $13.95 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Other networking-products names also enjoyed some eye-catching gains. Extreme Networks jumped 1.42, or 22%, to 7.84. Foundry Networks climbed 1.04, or 16%, to 7.37. Ciena improved 2.52, or 27%, to 12.03. All trade on the Nasdaq. 
The gains came after Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, told an audience at a broker-sponsored conference that the company felt comfortable with estimates for its earnings in the current quarter, which ends this month. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index, sparked by the bulge in technology prices, shot up 88.48, or 5.93%, the index's biggest one-day improvement since the spring, and the fifth-sharpest improvement this year, as well as the 14th-best one-day advance ever. The index finished the session at 1580.81, which is just above where it closed Sept. 10, the day before the terrorists struck the U.S. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which got a strong contribution from technology components like Microsoft and International Business Machines, climbed 173.19 points, or 1.93%. That was the ninth-sharpest one-day gain this year; the industrial average ended at 9123.78. 
""There was a real nice tone to the market today,"" said Pat Davis, head of Nasdaq trading at UBS Warburg, said. ""But I don't think you can say we've heard all the bad news we're going to hear. 
Over the past three weeks, Wall Street analysts had been systematically reducing their earnings projections to better reflect the deterioration in economic conditions. Only over the past several days had they begun to focus on valuations, saying that, in some instances, stock prices looked attractive, even projecting weaker earnings. 
Lehman Brothers, for example, jumped to the defense of some software names, and a number of those marked improvement. Shares of PeopleSoft gained 3.14, or 15%, to 23.68 on the Nasdaq, a 50% improvement over its Sept. 27 52-week low of 15.78. BMC Software added 74 cents, or 5.8%, to 13.60. 
A number of storage-products makers marked sharp improvements, after Dain Rauscher Wessels insisted high-quality names in the sector would be able to realize earnings targets. McData, for example, rose 2.11, or 26%, to 10.15, while QLogic shot up 5.89, or 33%, to 23.96, both on the Nasdaq. 
Several other sectors of the market, including those that have suffered most in the days since the attacks on Sept. 11, managed to mount recoveries. Shares of Delta Air Lines gained 2.27, or 8.4%, to 29.36. Continental Airlines advanced 1.93, or 11%, to 19.32. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1.45, or 7%, to 22.12. 
Shares of several insurers moved higher on the prospects of higher rates. Ace climbed 5.41, or 19%, to 34.31. Everest Re added 5.24, or 7.6%, to 73.80. XL Capital advanced 5.05, or 6.2%, to 86.45. 
Nortel Networks wasn't punished for warnings that it would report a much wider loss in the third quarter than analysts had been anticipating. Nevertheless, the stock finished 25 cents higher, up 4.7%, at 5.54. 
L-3 Communications added 4.22, or 4.7%, to 93.60, reaching a 52-week high. The New York maker of defense communications products signed an agreement to acquire the Canadian aviation-services provider Spar Aerospace. 
Sun Microsystems moved up 99 cents, or 12%, to 9 on the Nasdaq. The Palo Alto, Calif., networking-products developer said it received a two-year, $100 million sourcing pact from News Corp. 
Qwest Communications, which slumped to a 52-week low Tuesday, gained 1.60, or 10%, to 17.20. CIBC World Markets talked up the stock, citing its valuation. 
Eli Lilly fell 3.62, or 4.4%, to 79.25. The drug maker warned that sales of its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac have eroded faster than expected after it lost its patent protection two months ago. 
Shares of several independent energy marketers moved higher, helped by comments from Salomon Smith Barney, which said the recent selloff in the group left the stocks at attractive valuations. Enron gained 2.88, or 9.4%, to 33.49, Dynegy added 1.66, or 4.3%, to 39.96, and Duke Energy gained 37 cents, or 0.9%, to 39.60. 
Best Buy rose 3.70, or 9.2%, to 48.80 in what proved a strong session for retail, after Credit Suisse First Boston called the Minneapolis retailer the best name in hardline consumer-electronics retailing. 
Shares of some real-estate-investment trusts weakened, following skeptical comments on earnings from UBS Warburg. Boston Properties fell 1.48, or 3.9%, to 36.37, Simon Property, Indianapolis, eased 20 cents, or 0.7%, to 26.90, and Apartment Investment and Management, Denver, lost 1.56, or 3.5%, to 42.80. 
Idec Pharmaceuticals advanced 2.12, or 4.1%, to 53.74, on upbeat comments Dain Rauscher made about the drug developer.

Enron to sell assets in oil, gas off India 
BG Group pays $388 million; power plant is still on market 
By MICHAEL DAVIS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
British natural gas company BG Group has struck a deal to buy Enron Corp.'s offshore oil and natural gas properties in India for $388 million in cash, the companies said Wednesday. 
These properties are the last of the oil- and gas-producing properties Houston-based Enron retained after it spun off Enron Oil & Gas, now named EOG Resources. 
The deal marks another step for Houston-based Enron away from owning large physical assets. The company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities. 
It is ""another significant step for Enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses,"" the company said in a written statement. 
Enron's other assets for sale in India include the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's largest private power plant, in which Enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake. 
Reports surfaced Wednesday that Enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $3 billion project at a discount. Analysts have said for months now that Enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer. Tata Power Co., India's largest private electricity firm, has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over Dabhol. 
The oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the Tapti natural gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of Mumbai and a 62.6 percent interest in the offshore block CB-OS/1 exploration license. All are on the west coast of India. 
Production from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. Reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent. BG paid about $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent. 
The other partners in the Tapti and Panna/Mukta offshore operations are Oil and Natural Gas Corp., which holds 40 percent, and Reliance Industries, with a 30 percent stake. The other partners in the CB-OS/1 license are Hindustan Oil Exploration Co., with 17.36 percent, Tata Petrodyne with 10 percent, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. with 10 percent. 
Enron acquired its natural gas reserves in India with an eye to using them as fuel in the Dabhol plant. 
In August, Houston-based Enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in Dabhol for no less than $1 billion, an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project. 
Dabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer. It was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on India's west coast in June after the board stopped buying power. 
John Ambler, Enron spokesman, would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the Dabhol project, but said the company favors selling its stake. 
""We continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of India and/or Indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant,"" Ambler said. ""We are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs."" 
The shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2,184 megawatts. 
Other partners in Dabhol include General Electric and the Bechtel construction firm, which each own 10 percent. 
The remaining 15 percent is held by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located. 
BG's existing interests in India include holdings in western Indian natural gas distributors Gujarat Gas Co. and Mahanagar Gas. The company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from Iran via pipeline into India. 
India's gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years, while its gas production is declining. 


Edison rates to remain high under utility's deal with state
By KAREN GAUDETTE
Associated Press Writer

10/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Consumer advocates warn that Southern California Edison customers, already saddled with last spring's record rate increase until 2003, could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead. 
The deal secretly negotiated with the state Public Utilities Commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by Edison last November and is designed to keep the utility from following Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's largest utility, into bankruptcy.
It lets Edison pay off more than $3 billion of a $3.9 billion debt, in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last May for at least the next two years. 
Consumer advocates, however, said Wednesday that other consequences of the state's power crisis could send rates higher still. 
The state's power-buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $43 billion of long-term power already contracted for delivery. 
The prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some Edison customers. 
""We can't stay in business,"" said William Ho, general manager of Top Hat Cleaners in West Hollywood, where the monthly electric bill has gone from $600 before the state's energy crisis to nearly $1,200. ""We would have to raise prices, and we're already heading into a recession."" 
Ho said Top Hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows. But he added, ""You can't press clothes in the dark."" 
It's unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power-buying costs, said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group. 
Hoge and other consumer advocates said this week's deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of Edison, which supported the state's failed deregulation plan. 
""It's like saying I'm not going to beat you any harder, so it shouldn't hurt,"" she said. 
John Bryson, Edison International president and chief executive officer, said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors. 
Edison owes nearly $4 billion to hundreds of power companies, ranging from energy marketing giant Enron Corp. to the state Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. 
""The agreement means stability, predictability,"" he said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. ""It means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work."" 
The PUC said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power-buyer. Commission President Loretta Lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let Edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy. 
""I think that this is a balanced compromise, but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt,"" she said. 
The state Department of Water Resources so far has spent $9 billion buying electricity for customers of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. 
The shareholder-owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers. The state's 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers. 
That price cap was the focal point of Edison's lawsuit against the PUC, with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers. 
Under the deal struck this week, Edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $1.2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt. The utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators, and that money also would have to help pay down the debt. 
The agreement now goes before U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los Angeles, who could rule on it this week. 
""Right now Judge Lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers. ... Will he pull out $3.3 billion for Edison or will he protect the working men and women of California who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax?"" said Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which organized a protest rally Wednesday outside the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. 
Heller estimated the settlement could cost Edison ratepayers $750 each over the next four years.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., has defaulted on interest payment of $24 million to Indian lenders for its Dabhol phase II project, reports Press Trust of India news agency. 
""DPC has not made interest payments due on Sept. 30 to its Indian lenders (comprising) both rupee and dollar debts for the second phase,"" a DPC spokesman told PTI.
The Indian financial institutions have a 62.04 billion rupee ($1=INR47.925) exposure to the 1,444-megawatt Dabhol phase II, which is 96% complete. Foreign lenders have an exposure of around $444 million toward the project, the report added. 
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in DPC. Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

BG pays Enron pounds 263m for Indian oil and gas

BG IS TO BUY Enron's oil and gas assets off India's west coast for $388m (pounds 263m) in a move that will make the UK-based oil and gas producer the largest foreign investor in the country's upstream energy market. 
The deal will add 5 per cent to BG's total output, with 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, of which 60 per cent is gas. According to David McManus, BG's executive vice president, it will be earnings accretive from day one. ""There is currently a deficit between the supply of gas, which is currently all indigenous gas, and the need for gas within India,"" Mr McManus said.
Some analysts see demand doubling over the next 10 years, making India one of the world's fastest-growing energy markets. 
The assets being sold by the US group Enron include a 30 per cent stake in the Tapti field and the Panna Mukta field north-west of Bombay. 
BG shares closed down 2.5p at 261p in a mixed oil sector after the news. Mark Redway, an analyst at Teather & Greenwood, said: ""The logic is good and they're paying quite a low multiple at six or seven times last year's earnings, but [after the 11 September attacks in the US] there's a lot of investor nervousness at the moment over exposure to this part of the world.""

India: BG India to buy Enron's gas, oil assets

10/04/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

NEW DELHI, Oct. 3. BG India has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire Enron's offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $388 million. 
The contract signed on Tuesday night with Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd involves purchase of the latter's 30 per cent stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna-Mukta gas/oil fields besides the 62.64 per cent interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration block.
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr Nigel Shaw, BG India Chief Executive Officer, said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeholders agreeing to BG as the operator of the exploration fields. 
The rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a 40 per cent stakeholder in the Panna-Mukta, Tapti fields, besides a 10 per cent stake in the CB-OS/1 exploration block, seeking operatorship of the fields. 
When contacted, the ONGC Chairman, Mr Subir Raha, said, ""ONGC's position remains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields. We are currently in talks with BG on the issue."" 
""We are in talks with the Government as well as ONGC on the issue. We are not contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied,"" 
Mr Shaw replied when queried on the issue. He stressed that in case the other parties do not agree, the deal will fall through. ""We will walk away in such an event,"" he said. 
On the legality of ONGC's claim, Mr Shaw said, ""under the agreement, at the point of change of control (from Enron to BG), the other stakeholders can object to the transfer of operatorship (to BG). However, the contract is not clear on the deadlock."" 
Mr Shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end of the month. 
Currently, in the Tapti and Panna-Mukta gas fields, Reliance Industries Ltd holds 30 per cent stake while ONGC holds 40 per cent equity. In the case of the CB-OS/1 exploration field, Hindustan Oil and Exploration Company holds 17.36 per cent, Tata Petrodyne 10 per cent and ONGC 10 per cent. 
The BG vision: BG plans to double the gas production capacity of the Tapti gas fields by 2004, according to Mr Shaw. Though not willing to reveal the quantum of investment in the future, he said that BG would be committed to its share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on CB-OS/1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in December. 
""There is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this."" 
BG will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset (exploration field). However, the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields. Currently, the fields yield 70 million standard cu.feet of gas per day and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. 
BG has a 50 per cent stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd, a gas supply company in Mumbai. Further, it is in the process of setting up an LNG regassification terminal in Pipavav. 
BG is not interested in buying out Enron's upcoming LNG regassification facility at Dabhol since it is setting up its own LNG regassification terminal at Pipavav, Gujarat, Mr Shaw said. 
Mr Shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields, there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the LNG terminal and that from the exploration fields. 
On the pricing front, the Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004. Beyond this period, the pricing is internationally linked. 
Once the deal is completed, BG India plans to initiate talks with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and ONGC to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture, according to Mr Shaw. 
Further, it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in London as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum. 
BG has so far invested $150 million in its ventures in the country.

Former Enron executive to head homeland security 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Army Secretary Thomas White, a former Houston energy executive, has been picked to serve as the Defense Department's top official for homeland security. 
White will work closely with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who was named by President Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks to head a new Cabinet-level Office of Homeland Security. 
The new office will coordinate the efforts of more than 40 government agencies in tightening domestic security and rooting out terrorist threats. 
White was named to serve as the Pentagon's liaison by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on Tuesday. 
White is a retired Army brigadier general who became the Army's top civilian executive in May. Before he was nominated for the Army post by Bush, White was vice chairman of Houston-based Enron Energy Services. 
""In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, homeland security has emerged as a paramount national priority,"" White said. ""As the Department of Defense executive agent for homeland security, I look forward to working closely with Gov. Tom Ridge as he leads this vital effort."" 
A 23-year veteran of the Army, White served as executive assistant to Gen. Colin Powell while Powell headed the Joint Chiefs of Staff under former President Bush. Powell currently is secretary of state. 


British Gas to buy Enron's oil, gas assets for $388 m
Our Corporate Bureau New Delhi

10/04/2001
Business Standard

British Gas India today announced that it has reached an agreement to buy the assets of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd for $388 million. The assets include a 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas fields as well as a 62.64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the CB-OS/1 block. All three are located on the west coast of India and are operated by Enron. 
However, British Gas India chief executive officer Nigel Shaw said the deal is subject to the condition that British Gas gets operational control of the fields. ""If we are not the operator, we will walk away from the deal,"" he said. The deal, signed in London last night, would require clearance from the Indian government. Shaw revealed that British Gas India has already initiated a dialogue with the government for this.
But the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it has dried. The state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) which has a 40 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by Enron Oil & Gas. 
However, petroleum minister Ram Naik said ""all issues will be sorted out in due course"". ""Enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal. We will examine the issue,"" he said. 
According to oil industry sources, the operatorship is based on a consensus_and not on the percentage of shares held_among shareholders. The proposed sale of Enron's assets does not ""mean an automatic transfer of operatorship and the shareholders will have to come to a consensus,"" ONGC sources claim. 
What is more, ONGC had earlier unsuccessfully bid $350 million for Enron's oil and gas assets. ONGC has the first right of refusal, according to an ONGC official. ONGC chairman S Raha was unavailable for comment. 
Shaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of operating the oil and gas fields. 
""We are in active discussion with both ONGC and Reliance. We are hopeful of wrapping it up by the end of this month,"" Shaw said. 
An ONGC official, however, said the state-owned company was aware of the development but had not been informed officially by Enron. 
Shaw also disclosed that British Gas was willing to make further investments to ramp up production at the Tapti and the Panna/Mukta fields. 
""Further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree. We are looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004,"" he said. 
When asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise, Shaw said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meters of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil a day. 
An Enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a Reliance spokesman. 
Enron Oil & Gas has 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas and Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, ONGC has a 40 per cent interest and Reliance has the remaining 30 per cent. 
In the case of CB-OS/1, the other partners are Hindustan Oil Exploration Company with 17.36 per cent and Tata Petrodyne and ONGC with 10 per cent each.

I got a hold of Southern finally, and Mark Watts is out until Monday. The 
assistant who I spoke to knew pretty much nothing about this, so he said he 
couldn't verify whether or not they would be willing to ADP the deal. But 
according to our traders, they spoke with Mark Watts yesterday afternoon, and 
he agreed to ADP the December futures deal.

If this still seems to be a problem, please let me know. Otherwise I'll plan 
on talking to Watts on Monday.

Thanks,
Kate

1. Strong buy: License to ring
Licensing DSL technology could help position Aware (AWRE) for the future.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

An uncertain economic environment and a semiconductor market at
trough revenue levels means that this may be a good time for
investors to look into the semiconductor intellectual property
(SIP) sector.

In the broadband communications field, Aware (AWRE) develops and
licenses DSL technology to semiconductor and equipment companies
for use in conjunction with existing copper telephone networks.
The company also makes software for IP products for voice- and
video-enabled applications and video games.

Aware mainly competes with other companies' in-house development
and design teams, and with many corporations looking for cost-
cutting options, Aware is in a strong position to cash in.

2. Independent exchanges: How the survivors have evolved
From passive transaction-based units to active technology providers and, ultimately, proselytizers

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the beginning of 2001, eMarketer selected five so-called
""independent exchanges"" that we believed were worth watching
during the course of the year. Chosen for the diversity of their
vertical industry operations, these benchmark exchanges were
noted as useful indicators of the success or failure of online
exchange-based trade within various industries.
Known as a pioneer within the energy industry and among business-
to-business (B2B) exchanges in general, Altra Market Place was
placed on the list because of its background as a facilitator of
commodity-based trade. Citadon has long emphasized its Web-based,
collaborative software for the engineering and building industry,
while eMerge Interactive (EMRG) was initially known as a cattle
broker with extensive online and offline trading operations.
MetalSite was selected because of its presence within the highly-
competitive online steel-trading industry, and SciQuest (SQST)
was noted for its leadership as a provider of Internet-based
catalog and trading technology for the life sciences industry.

3. The real deal: Five fateful days
Five January days that could determine the course of the year, and four picks from the guru

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

After a two-year route that saw the market experience it's worse
performance since 1973-74, investors are going to begin the year
hoping for the best but not forcing the issue. Reluctance to buy
this market could result in a lackluster first week.

The old saying is that as January goes, so goes the rest of the
year (in fact traditionalists say the first five days of the year
will determine the outcome for the rest of the year). I'm not so
sure that will be applicable to the market this year.

Instead, it could be the last 5 days of the month that sets the
tone for the rest of the year. On the 29th, the Fed gathers for
the first FOMC meeting of the year. After 11 rate cuts last year,
it will be interesting to see whether Greenspan and company
decide to take the scalpel to rates again. We think the market
has a better chance of making a serious rally if the Fed chooses
to stand pat.

4. Click and file: Taxes-dot-com
Two widely different strategies for navigating the tax Web

By Dave Sterman

For the last four years, the number of people filing their taxes
online has risen by at least 20 percent annually. And the folks
at Intuit (INTU) deserve a bunch of credit for the trend.
Intuit's TurboTax software has made it increasingly easy to
complete and files taxes electronically, eliminating the mistake-
filled pen and paper process.

Curiously, H&R Block (HRB) has gone a different route. The tax
prep giant has stuck by its bricks and mortar model of handling
taxes in person. Block's TaxCut software also enables people to
do their taxes on a PC, but the company has done little to create
a commanding Web presence.

WHITMAN SAYS ENVIRONMENT STILL PROTECTED DESPITE
ANTI-TERRORISM FOCUS

Despite taking on new responsibilities in response to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA will continue to ensure the
quality of the nation's air, water, and land is protected,
Administrator Whitman says in an interview with BNA. ""We've
obviously had to reallocate, shift some resources and people
around in order to meet the responsibilities post-September
11th,"" Whitman says. But the various offices of EPA are
""continuing to do what they need to do. We're continuing to
work on the issues that are priorities."" Whitman says the
agency is not diverting resources from high-priority
matters, like superfund cleanups, ""but we've asked everyone
to go back and reprioritize and see if there are other
cleanups that are not very environmentally sensitive."" . . .

U.S. COURT AFFIRMS CLASSIFICATION OF DIOXIN AS 'KNOWN' HUMAN
CARCINOGEN

The Department of Health and Human Services acted reasonably
in upgrading dioxin from a ""reasonably anticipated"" to a
""known"" human carcinogen in the National Toxicology Program
list, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The court's decision is
expected to have major implications for EPA's ongoing
reassessment of the risks of dioxin. The agency hopes to
complete its final reassessment of dioxin early next year. .

EMPLOYEES OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAB ACQUITTED OF CHARGES OF
FALSIFYING DATA

Eight former employees of Intertek Testing Services
Environmental Labs Inc., an environmental testing firm, are
found not guilty by a federal court jury in Dallas, Texas,
of charges that they falsified test data in order to meet
quality standards required by EPA. The lab analyzed samples
of air, liquids, soils, pesticides, explosives, and
nerve/chemical agents for consulting firms, engineering
companies, and federal, state, and local governments,
according to the Department of Justice. . . . Page A-2

EPA ENDS REVIEW OF FUMIGANT TELONE, SAYS BENEFITS OUTWEIGH
RISKS

EPA says it has ended a special review of cancer risks posed
by the fumigant telone, finding the pesticide's benefits
outweigh its risks. The fumigant is an alternative to methyl
bromide, which is being phased out under the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. . . .

COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED ON WHOLE EFFLUENT TOXICITY TEST
METHODS

The comment period on a proposed rule updating methods for
measuring whole effluent toxicity in effluents and the
waters into which they are discharged is extended by EPA
until Jan. 11, 2002. The proposed rule would modify whole
effluent toxicity test procedures, which seek to
characterize effluent as a whole in terms of its toxic
effects on certain test species. . . . Page A-3

BESTFOODS FOUND NOT LIABLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS AT MICHIGAN
SUPERFUND SITE

A federal court finds Bestfoods Inc. is not liable for
superfund cleanup costs at the site of a chemical
manufacturing plant in Muskegon County, Mich. The U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan decides
the Englewood, N.J.-based food-processing company is not
responsible for cleanup costs because Michigan and EPA
failed to prove the company, and not its subsidiary, Ott
Chemical Co., actually operated the plant. . . . Page A-8

WORK BLOCKED IN EFFORT TO TREAT SEWAGE GENERATED BY TIJUANA,
MEXICO

Millions of gallons of Tijuana wastewater continue to flow
daily from Mexico into the United States as bureaucratic
infighting, legal challenges, and international
complications stall efforts to achieve secondary treatment
levels. Litigation and infighting block what began as a U.S.
effort to help Mexico's state of Baja California clean the
wastewater its Tijuana River brings north and into U.S.
coastal waters. . . . Page A-6

you got paid extra for the horse and the body double work!

Subject: A Star is Born!

I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in 
is Gladiator.  This is major!  I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of 
the summer, and probably the year.  How will I know which barbarian is you?  
Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell 
it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!

This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for 
you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)...

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.  From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff"

To alert you to another item that may arise:  Some industrials have air 
permits that restrict them to running for self-supply backup generation 
only.  In such case, the air permit may have to be amended by the industrial 
before it can sell to the grid.  Feel free to call upon Gov't Affairs if you 
have a question about this.

Subject: Interconnection: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials  

*****Please note that with the authorization below, interconnection issues 
with the attached utility still need to be addressed.  (This includes 
agreement, queue, facilities if needed, etc.)  Call us if you need 
assistance.  Thanks.


   



Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I 
have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the 
General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business 
call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to 
maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with 
everything else.

Greetings Everyone --

You may have noticed that your paycheck stubs reflect vacation and sick leave 
balances that are inaccurate.  Due to EWC being acquired mid calendar year, 
and GE ""grandfathering"" in our vacation levels, the balances as stated on 
your check stub will differ from your actual balances.  So, for the balance 
of this calendar year (2002), all vacation and sick time balances will be 
tracked locally on our own HRIS System (at GE Wind in Tehachapi).  

Human Resources will provide you with your true balances by the following 
method:

The first of every month Human Resources will print out a hard copy of your 
vacation and sick leave balances.
Employees located in the North and South Tehachapi facilities will be able to 
pick up a hard copy of their balances from their respective facility 
receptionists.
Remote site employees' balances will be mailed to the respective Site 
Supervisors for distribution.

Thank you for your continued understanding through the integration process.

Not sure if you had seen this language from the NY PSC.  While great, this 
clearly means that NY PSC commissioners will begin to think alot about how

Subject: NYPSC approves market-based backout credit for RG&E; Adopts Enron 
Online as Index

Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on ""a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform.""  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says 
$0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states 
$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Dave,

Just wanted to update you on the correlations. Luis did not have any high yield fibers prices that we talked about yesterday. The only thing available was the mixed paper prices which I tried to correlate to tissue but the correlation coefficient came at 15%.

Also, I spoke with Ryan Ogden at Bureau of Labor Stats and it didn't seem like they had the prices for those recycled products. In any case, I asked him to email me whatever they have in their website in terms of paper prices and I am expecting that email today. Hopefully smth good will come out of that.

                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 01, 2001

Notice ID: 3144
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Due to long-wall mining activity occurring under Columbia's Line SM-123 in
Mingo County, WV, the line will be taken out of service.  Columbia anticipates
this outage to begin in late October 2001 and run through approximately
mid-November 2001.  However, the start date and duration of the outage is
contingent upon the actual timing and progress of the long-wall mining
activity.  Given the level of firm commitments in this area, Columbia believes
that there will be no available capacity for interruptible transportation.  The
following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact your Customer Services Team.

Mark-

Please look at deal # 474762 APS for a total of 19 MWh (8+11MWh). I have 
found this deal in EnPower and in ETS and on the El Paso model.  The 
outstanding question is was the price $200 or $250?  El Paso has it at $250 
and EnPower has it at $200.  

Please advise ASAP

Thanks,

Hey Bruce,

The 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes.  I didn't mean to imply Cinergy wouldn't pay out; I meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects.  Startup prospects are, I think, more risky.

Also, I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston.  My ""reluctance"" is more of a family/moving type of thing.  It is an issue, but not a huge one.

Thanks,

Sean

Subject:	RE:

Thanks for the update.  I will forward this information.  I assume that the
low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the company
you will receive the min amount.  Is that true?  As far as Cinergy having a
payout record- it does.  The bonus plan pays out 17% of profits, I don't
think there is any other company paying that kind of money.  They paid on it
last year.  However, the P&L has to be there, but the money was distributed.
Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesn't enter into
performance.  I think that is unique as well.

As far as Houston goes, I can show you parts of the city that are beautiful
and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous
value.  I'm 15 minutes from every venue (sport, education, theatre, musuems)
in the fourth largest city in America.  In addition, your family will not be
trapped to one employer.  I lived in a few places and visited numerous
others, I think its the best value city in the country.  In addition, with
the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas.  And
being in the energy trading business, it has no peer.

Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite
frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two
other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the
second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around
$275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as
incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first
to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350
to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about
$725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for
me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a
big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.
Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty
confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the
prospects of being on the ""ground floor"" with Cinergy, I also have to
recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the
probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would
require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still
participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be
willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath
us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some
serious money for the company.

Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve
your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious
money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also
extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on ""Comments"" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on ""comments"" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on ""send"" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Hey gang - just a reminder I have you guys down for the concert on Wed., 
April 11th.  That's the week after next.  If, for any reason, you can't 
make 
it, let me know and I will get some other takers for the tickets. 
Thanks!

The changes look fine.  When do you plan to execute?  Accounting (Jody 
Pierce's group) needs to know when funds must go out to GE.

I got this form agreement from Jeff.  It was prepared recently for PEMEX.  I understand it was approved for general use by Susan.  All I've done so far is change the names of the Parties and change the description of the purpose and asked Steve for comments on these questions:

	1.  TW or ETS?  Steve would like this to be as broad as possible, but ETS probably isn't a legal entity that can enter into contracts.  When we looked at TransColorado, we used Enron Pipeline Company.  Stan is an officer and can execute documents for EPC.  Steve wanted the Party defined to be broad so that it could encompass several possible entities on Enron's part.

	2.  Is the ""purpose"" appropriate per the discussions Steve had with Questar?  Steve said that the agreement should express the intent to evaluate for a partnership interest, possibly operating the Southern Trail facilities and/or purchasing a portion of Southern Trails.  Again, in any event, to be broad in this description.

I was going to discuss these points with Legal and get a final blessing and send over to Gary Schmitt (his e:mail is garysc@questar.com)"

Subject: NABA photo shoot


EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite
Enron's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of
Black Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas,
Texas.  NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans
in the fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy,
Sally, Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.
We also need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check
for the photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about Enron's participation in this conference and look
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

Gwynn

Michael,
 Grant Oh of the Calgary office seems to be okay with your requested 
modification of the interrruptible spot confirm.  As such, please prepare an 
amendment document to add your language as an Appendix to the terms of the 
spot confirm, have it signed and forward to Grant Oh and myself for 
approval.  Thereafter we will have it signed and by Enron and will return a 
fully executed copy to you.

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you."

 ""Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student""

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, ""What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?""  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  ""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""Heil
Hitler"" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

Will you change the world today?

On May 20 this year, we announced our intention to develop a liquid market =

they owned and =01&prices=018 as something that they controlled or numbers =

market research group published an article about our proposal entitled Grea=

Idea, Wrong Company.  One of our major competitors=01*an experienced tradin=

firm=01*proclaimed that they knew markets, and that telecom capacity would =
never=20
be a commodity market, as if that were something bad. =20

We love it when people say it can=01,t be done.

Today, Enron transacted the first commodity bandwidth trade.  This is Day O=
ne=20
of a potential trillion-dollar-a-year market.  Global Crossing was the=20
counterparty to this first trade, and we expect to close a few more deals=
=20
with other companies before the end of the year.

This is an outstanding accomplishment for a team and a firm that just seems=

to keep producing unbelievable innovations.

Can you think of any other firm that could have pulled this off?  I can=01,=

We did it first because we were the only ones who could do it at all.  As a=

result, we will be able to offer our clients unique services that our=20
competitors have not even dreamed of yet.  We will attract first a whole ne=

	One of the to-do's at the end of our recent conference call was to determine whether we wanted to do an end-run around ONEOK's desire to use the PTR system during the special test by buying or leasing a meter to use in place of the rich inlet meter.  Don Hawkins just called to advise that Phil Lowry has authorized spending $100,000 to buy a new meter and associated piping for this purpose.  We will also be spending the money to have it flow tested.  Charlie Thompson is now contacting Instromet to see if they will sell us one for that price and how quickly we can get delivery.

	I will keep you advised.

Can I get an updated spreadsheet (the one you sent yesterday outlining which prices we have received and which ones we have not)  from you or someone in your group?

like tom changed/flipped the prices.  Thanks for following up.

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Re: Fact Sheet on Shareholder Proposal and Columbia Hills  

Friends---I'm in quite a rush to catch a flight, so keep that in mind if my 
comments aren't as articulate as we might prefer (though I did today again 
speak personally with Lauren by phone, Paula Reiker [by coincidence of 
meeting her alone in the elevator this morning], Steve Kean in person and 
Mark palmer several times in person about this since our conference call 
Friday. I think everyone has a good idea, first hand, of my thinking on this 
matter.

Let's be careful not to try to pit the alleged Yakimas intervening in this 
matter, against the ""real"" Tribe (even though we know there is divergence in 
their respective  thinkings and radicalism).  This delicate situation can be 
managed and I'm happy to handle it if needed. 
 Keep in mind that Tribes work like most of our dysfunctional families: 
you can tell me something bad about your mother and your brother can give me 
a better opinion about her;  if I don't like your mother and try to use you 
to defend my position against your brother, it's likely both you and your 
brother will team up against me.  ""sacred' grounds, even ""alleged 'sacred  
grounds' "" are somewhat moving targets and somewhat personal--no matter how 
wacky, one Indian wouldn't want to be put in a back-against-the-wall position 
of denying another Indian's claim of sacred grounds.  Yet again let me say, 
this situation between the groups is  manageable and I believe we can, when 
necessary, work with the ""real"" Tribe in the same, very amicable way we've 
been doing since 1997, to resolve this for the Wind Group should we ever 
decide to go forward.

Here's a red-lined version of my comments.

Thanks--I'll be travelling through Tuesday morning, but can be reached 
through all the usual alternative routes (phone mail is best--3-6117).

Thanks!!---Christie.

Hey there team,

Now that the mid term is over, I actually read Chapter 20 - confusing
stuff.  Just to clarify, the SF group will take the first three questions
and the east bay group will take the last two?

Also, we need to make a correction to the original assignments, some of
these have dates and some refer to the case chapters, please see
clarification below:

I will do my best to have something coherent for the SF group by Thursday
or Friday for the Ch 20 case.

Steve,

Per your request, I've attached a summary of credit exposure with PG&E as of 
close of business on February 28th. We are investigating an increase in our 
overall position as a result of basis movement in the west over the past few 
days.

Please feel free to give me a call at 35856 if I can provide futher 
information.

Small stuff is staggerd Choice Capacity from LDC, no problem. 10,000 and 8,000
packages appear to be winter supplies for C&I. As long as ENA buys monthly
capacity for C&I market that extra Choice capacity can't cover, we should be
OK.

All:

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Jennings"

Hi Sally,

My name is Luis Bravo, we met about a month ago in an Associates happy hour (I'm the intern who was trying -without success- to meet with you last summer), right now I am an Associate at EES, structuring businesses. 

First of all thanks for inviting us (Associates) to join your meeting. It was a very illustrative as well as an entertaining one -nice video by the way. 

I am writing you because I am very interested in getting to know more about the Risk Management operations at Enron Networks so it would be ideal for me to meet with you to talk about it; however, if not possible in the mean time, I would also appreciate if you could give me some names of people that I could contact to so that I can get acquainted of this side of Enron Networks operations.

Thanks a lot, 

Regards,

Luis Bravo"

______________________________________________

Greetings Friends,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance with 
Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court, and Governor 
Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that state's 25 electoral votes.  It is 
now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of incorporation for the 
Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As 
past transition foundations have done, we are applying for 501(c)(4) status 
from the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as our 
team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition process in the short 
period between now and inauguration day, January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in 1988, 
specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it also makes 
provisions for raising contributions from private sources to help defray 
transition-related expenses.  This has been done previously, most recently in 
1992.  We are now soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  
Would you please visit our new transition website at 
www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our secure server.

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from individuals.  No 
corporate or political action committee contributions will be accepted.  
Contributions may not exceed $5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all 
contributors, in compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure 
of financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website on a 
real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against an individual's 
annual political contribution federal giving limit of $25,000.

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to establish a 
government that will unify our country and make the common principles we 
share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's finance 
office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries should be directed to 
our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900. Your support of the Bush/Cheney 
Presidential Transition Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,


Donald L. Evans

Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia

""One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely 
whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a 
reasonable interpretation of Florida law, 'legally cast vote[s].'  The 
counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten 
irreparable harm to petitioner, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon 
what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election.  Count first, and rule 
upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that 
have the public acceptance democratic stability requires.""

""Another issue in this case, moreover, is the propriety, indeed the 
constitutionality, of letting the standard for determination of voters' 
intent- dimpled chad, hanging chads, etc.- vary from county to county, as the 
Florida Supreme court opinion, as interpreted by the Circuit Court, permits.  
If petitioner [Bush] is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful, 
permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an 
accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later, since it is 
generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the 
ballots, which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate.""

Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T. Wells


DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS
""I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand scrutiny which 
will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution.""
Excerpt:
""I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not 
question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the 
majority. However, I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to 
reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process. I also believe 
that the majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will 
certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution.""

""My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no foundation 
in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at anytime until 
the issuance of this opinion. The majority returns the case to the circuit 
court for this partial recount of  under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at 
best, ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others, the 
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally unknown. 
That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority 
creates.""

""This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over 
continued judicial process. I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos, a 
professor of mathematics at Temple University, when he wrote that, ""[t]he 
margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory, 
no matter who wins."" Further judicial process will not change this 
self-evident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder. Justice 
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action 
sixty-four years ago. I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls.""

Scott - I have a few more relevant facts for you: 

1. Peter Quine's letterhead (re: letter received by V&E 11 Aug 2000) shows an 
apparent company name of 'e-nvironmental trading'.  Yet, interestingly, the 
squatted enronmetals.com website has references per Fig. 1 below to:

 - 'WE ARE ENVIRONMETALS' - appears upon mouse-over of the faux logo ' 
ENviRONMEnTALS.COM'
 - 'Manufactured Metal Miscellany' 

If Mr. Quine were acting in good faith, I believe he should have a good 
explanation for the what the connection might be between 'environmentals 
trading' and 'manufactured metals miscellany'.   Is he concerned with 
environmentals or environmetals ?  (Please See Figure 3 and comments below to 
see the rather dubious connection between the two.)

Fig. 1 - www.enronmetals.com - homepage



Figure 2 - 'Contact Us' page

- This is misleading/misrepresentative since users would be led to believe 
that they may be contacting Enron Metals (vs. e-nvironmental trading) when 
they are invited to send email to :   'anyquestions@enronmetals.com'


Figure 3 - 'About Us' page

- contains text: 
'We are a Brighton based group whose aim is to bring together
makers-suppliers-collectors
of environmentally-friendly
metals objets'





In addition, I checked on the register.com site and found that the website:  
www.environmetals.com  has NOT been registered to anyone and is still 
available for purchase.  I would argue that if Peter Quine were acting in 
good faith, he would have already purchased this name .

Also, can you contact EasySpace, the host/ISP for both enronmetals.com and 
enronmetals.co.uk to instruct them that the names are in dispute so we can 
have the .com site suspended?  The enronmetals.co.uk site simply calls up a 
'holding page' at the moment:




EasySpace can be reached at:

Technical Contact, Registrar:
   ""Mr Easyspace Hostmaster"" <hostmaster@easyspace.com>
   Phone: http://www.easyspace.com/   Fax:   +44 1932 350 222

(For the .co.uk  name, I believe Nominet (http://www.nominet.org.uk/) will 
have to authorize the ownership transfer, whereas for the .com name, 
EasySpace should be able to handle the transfer).  

Hope this helps.
-Paul

The documents corresponding to the above dates were already forwarded to you 
by Justin Boyd.  Further relevant facts may be forthcoming from Felipe Foy of 
our IT team, but I believe you now have more than sufficient factual 
information to proceed with this. 

I also strongly suggest that the ISPs hosting these sites are immediately 
notified of pending arbitration in both the US and UK so that the 2 websites 
will be suspended from operation immediately.  I believe in the US (and 
v.likkely the UK) that the hosting ISP must by law suspend any websites until 
the domain name dispute resolution process has been carried out, though I may 
be mistaken.

Jay--Couple notes:

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers ""material changes"".  You 
may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok 
with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to 
should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change.

Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced 
construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of 
easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing 
to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to 
proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the 
costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC 
decision.]]  Thanks.

I agree with Dave.  I'd agrue for 120 if I thought I could get away with it.

Frankly, I am more comfortable with 90 days.  Its easier to complete a 
project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go 
back and ask for more time.  Depending on the size of the plant and location, 
we may be faced with a lot of checking equipment records and field checks to 
verify ratings.  I'll ask Gary Lindland how he feels about reducing the time 
line.

>>> MICHELE FARRELL 03/16/01 11:02AM >>>
Any feedback on Enron's comments on our draft interconnection procedures that 
Jay sent out last night?  Jay and I are trying to get the DC attorneys on the 
phone to incorporate some changes.  In particular, Enron wants us to put in a 
shorter time for completing the Interconnection Facilities study (60 rather 
than 90 days).  Enron says we would still have the flexibility to take longer 
if we notify the customer that we need more time.  How do Dave and Jim feel 
about that proposal?

Please be advised that I will begin sending you California/National Power 
related messages twice a day (one during the mid-day and again in the late 
afternoon), in order to avoid a sporatic flow of emails.

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, ""satisfactory"", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=
ve=20
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns."

I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old 
stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid 
for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.

I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!

Subject: FW: New lease option

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new 
Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that 
we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According 
to Greg Krause, the only thing associated with Voyager was an old 
interconnect study request that was paid for and never used.  I feel 
confident that Voyager is ""clean"" to use.

I talked to Kay about the new land option Greg will be negotiating this 
weekend in Homestead.  She said to put the options in the terminal company, 
not Lauderdale Land, LLC as you had suggested.  Pick one of the other LLCs 
for me and let me know the name.

Thanks.

FTR team,

The copy of the auction results that you got at yesterday's meeting is 
incorrect. What happened was when I tried to sort the entire page, I only 
highlighted the related column and expected Excel 98 would sort the whole 
page. (As Steve told me before, I should highlight the whole thing if I try 
to do sorting in Excel). I appolized for the misleading and have redone the 
whole thing.  Thanks for the patience. Wish you all have a great weekend.

Good article.  These consultants / academics work for the group we are 
talking to about writing a ""what if no deregulation"" piece for Enron and 
hopefully others.

Sounds like something we would have written.  Teece is the Chairman of LECG 
with whom I met yesterday.  Spiller and Schmuel are two UC Berkeley 
professors who are principals at LECG.  I don't know when they wrote this or 
if they're trying to get it placed.  Teece forwarded it to me today.
Best,

Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. 
One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This 
may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now 
work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden.

Thanks for your help.

Jeff:? The FCC 214 number we discussed references a license as an Interstate 
Carrier, which you should apparently not need at this junture.? However, can 
you send the document itself regarding this issue to make sure? 
???????? Texas requires an inital COA or SPCOA (certificate of operating 
authority) depending on your business plan, and the CLEC application asks for 
NECA 
( National Exchange Carriers Association) i.d. number if you have one; it 
also asks for a FCC CIC (Carrier Identification Code) ""if available"" - 
perhaps this is what you were referring to; and that would probably not be an 
impediment to filing. 
??? Anita can check with Texas if you need more information - we do it all 
the time and so it's no problem. Thanks.

Nothing seems to be recorded re the alledged $3.5m in options. Kari and I believe it could be the old ECT LTCP projected value which would be entirely separate from his contract, however we will dig some more. If he has documentation/emails, love to see them.

Barbara,

We shall extend the funding for the seminar in the fall for the next season.

I shall be glad to cover the cost of a coffee mug with our logos. Can you 
identify a
producer who can come up with a design?
I think that we may use the company that produces
RICE memorabilia.

I shall run  the design through our PR Department and then we can have it
produced.

Vince

Subject: Rice/Enron Finance Seminar Series


Vince:

I have checked with our accounting folks and it looks like the balance in
the seminar account is under $5000.  This will get us going in the fall so
we have some flexibility for the next Enron funding - whatever works best
on your end.

Also, I am interested in pursuing the idea of designing some sort of a gift
- a coffee cup perhaps - to give to our seminar guests.  I think we could
do something neat with the Enron and Rice/JGS logos that folks would be
happy to display on their shelf or desk top.  What do you think?

As always, thank you so much for your support of our efforts over here.  It
is truly appreciated.

bbo

All:

For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics. Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.

Late Wednesday, FERC issued a notice of staff conference discussing issues 
pertinent to Order No. 637.  This is the second of three public conferences 
to be held on January 31 at 1:00 p.m. to be held at FERC's offices. Panel 
Participants will be debating issues concerning the market consequences of 
transactions between pipelines and affiliates.  Since parties will not be 
making an oral presentation, it is requested that written comments be 
submitted to FERC by January 5, 2001 to 1) provide input on how to structure 
the discussion; 2) identify issues and examples to foster a meaningful 
dialog; and 3) suggest questions the staff moderator may wish to pose to the 
panel.  Attached is the Notice.

Students,

Most of you seem to have figured out that the first library workshops are
in January, not in June as I erroneously said in my email to you. Thanks to
the sharp-eyed students who brought this to my attention. The website does
have the month right!

I encourage all of you but especially the first year students to sign up
for these as they will ground you in using information resources
intelligently and efficiently.

In the Room

Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a 
few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended 
for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other 
ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).
Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the 
IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The 
prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.
Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible 
on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).
IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., 
BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.
Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.
Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part 
existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with 
the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate 
increase.
Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough
Enron able to take low profile.
SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing 
could be achieved.
Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed 
epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  

Out of the Room

Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.
Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC 
involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable 
resolution.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks

Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's 
meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC 
is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.
His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 
12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its 
supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward 
contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose 
this, I believe.
Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA."

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I'm contacting you to let you know of an exciting opportunity to speak
at the Spring 2001 InformationWeek Conference to be held April 1-4,
2001, at the Ritz Carlton in Amelia Island, Florida.

Each year, the editors of InformationWeek choose a theme for the
conference that brings to life our editorial point of view -- the very
reflection of developments and trends in business and IT.  This year
our theme is: ""Radical Simplicity: The Drive to Conquer
Complexity and Enhance Customer Value."" E-business has
revolutionized the global economy. But it's also built complexity
directly into the very technologies that were intended to facilitate
business among companies and their customers and suppliers. As the
technologies designed to link more partners became more complex, so
too did the business processes for which they were used.  This
Conference will highlight the drive toward simplicity ? in technology,
in business models, in business processes, in corporate culture, in the
economy. And in the very way companies interact with their
customers.

Based on the role you and your enterprise are playing in your industry
segment and from our recent coverage of Enron, we know that this
fundamental concept, driven by technology, is helping your
organization redefine itself to build better customer relationships and
face new competitors in today's fast-changing economy.  As such,
we'd like to invite you to speak in a session at this Conference.

Our semi-annual InformationWeek Conference is a unique blend of
professional development, research, and peer-to-peer networking. If
you're able to participate, you'll be joined by close to 500 other senior
IT and business executives, in addition to other industry experts. With
your contributions and those of your peers, The InformationWeek
Conference truly is like a special issue of the magazine come alive!

We hope that you'll be able to attend. I, or one of my colleagues, will
be calling to discuss this speaking opportunity with you in the next
week.  Best wishes and we look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,



Brian Gillooly

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for 
Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters.  
M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty 
scary.  If ""W"" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the 
Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get 
together.  I will work on that when the time comes.  Besides, this election 
is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with 
all this contesting.  How is everything going?  What are you guys doing for 
the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver 
Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be 
better next time about getting back to you.  Good to hear from you!
Ben"

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: AMY LARSEN DeCARLO
on STORAGE IN THE ENTERPRISE
Today's Focus: The storage revolution has begun
03/07/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: The storage revolution has=20
begun
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Amy Larsen DeCarlo

Believe the hype. We are in the middle of a storage revolution.
Virtually overnight, businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to
terabytes of data, and the number of users accessing that information is
skyrocketing.  The subsequent requirements are forcing companies to
rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of
storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery.

It isn=01,t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that
are changing how businesses handle storage.  The premium that companies
place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound
effect on their storage requirements.  Businesses demand fault-tolerant
storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their
employees, suppliers and customers.

But given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements, on average,
double every 12 months, while processor speeds double every 18 months,
companies are left with a quandary: How can they manage the
proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for
the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds?

The simple answer to this question is to institute a well-executed
storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in
advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support
those needs.  Bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not
from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those
systems.

There are several ways to efficiently manage storage. One of the best
routes is consolidation  that is, pooling resources and managing
storage as a system, as opposed to a decentralized collection of file
servers. This may sound like a throwback to an earlier era, when
enterprise storage resided on mainframes. But it=01,s actually a
progressive step, as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing
the planning, management, and ongoing support of storage systems than it
does with the physical location of the files.

Next, it is important to recognize that not all information is equally
important to the organization.  Consequently, storage requirements vary
by business application. As in all areas of IT, it is important to make
storage implementation decisions based on business needs.

Businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for
alternatives to the distributed file server storage model. They want to
speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth-intensive backup and
recovery operations from the LAN.

Network-attached storage (NAS) supplies IT professionals with one
answer, giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to
stored data. NAS devices, which have been widely available for years,
are optimized to process I/O transactions.  Though they promise better
performance, they don=01,t remove backups from the transport network.
Instead, they supply a relatively easy-to-deploy solution to cross-
platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments.

Many consider storage-area networks  (SAN) to be the best long-term
answer to current and future storage challenges. Because SANs are
designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network, they
alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated
with more traditional storage models. Yet, given the early deployment
stage most companies are still in, many of those capabilities are still
largely untested in a production environment.

This newsletter will examine how, through effective storage management,
IT professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery
to their customers.  This newsletter will not focus on items like the
least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library.  Instead, it will
look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging
technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues.
Ultimately, the goal is to identify storage technology options and
practices that work in real-world environments.

You will probably be glad you didn't go.   If the boys are in jail in Mexico, you may have to run the desk the next week.

A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.

We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.

Are you guys in?   We will have a blast."

NEWS
Davis Puts His Spin on Energy Crisis / He polls voters, sends faxes defending 
charges of critics
Patrick Hoge
Chronicle Staff Writer

02/15/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A3
(Copyright 2001)

While Gov. Gray Davis is searching for answers to California's energy crisis, 
he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to 
convince ""opinion leaders"" that he is taking decisive action. 
Interviews with Davis' pollster, lawmakers and those on the receiving end of 
the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and 
politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch.
Recently, as independent polls showed that 3 in 4 Californians believe the 
crisis is the state's No. 1 problem, Davis backed a bill that could lead to 
electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them. 
Last week, the governor's office sent a statement titled ""Meeting the Energy 
Challenge"" to nearly 2,000 ""opinion leaders and decision- makers,"" touting 
Davis' record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to 
act. 
Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson, whose 
Humboldt County office received one of the faxes, was offended by what he saw 
as an attempt to manipulate him. 
""Making it political provides no solutions,"" said an angry Hanson, whose 
district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially $50,000 higher 
this school year. ""The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility 
boggles my mind."" 
Davis' aides insist that the governor isn't preoccupied with the views of 
voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy 
issue since last summer. Some critics suggest that Davis' fear of a public 
backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy 
crisis. 
""That's ridiculous,"" said Davis pollster Paul Maslin. ""We do a lot less 
polling than anybody understands. For significant periods of this entire 
issue, there has not been polling going on. It's a far cry from (the) 
perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled."" 
The surveys of Californians, which are paid for by Davis' political campaign, 
help frame issues and determine factors such as the public's willingness to 
conserve, Maslin said. The responses are not used to guide intricate policy 
decisions, he said. 
At the same time, however, Maslin explained that his polling shows residents 
clearly don't want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free 
market; they want some kind of government command of the system; and they're 
willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty. 
""If you had to boil it down, they want greater control here somehow,"" Maslin 
said. ""I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to 
listen to that right now."" 
In fact, recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature -- such as the 
state's $10 billion purchase of long-term power or a state takeover of the 
utility transmission system -- show they are addressing such concerns. 
Political analysts say Davis' polling reflects a pervasive reliance by 
politicians at all levels of government on public opinion -- a focus that is 
not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy. 
Indeed, Davis is not alone. Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their 
own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend $400 million in taxpayer 
money to buy electricity. 
Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are 
often uneducated about the issues, said Professor Barbara O'Connor, director 
of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State 
University, Sacramento. 
""I think it's the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior 
on what people think of them,"" O'Connor said. 
The state GOP might agree. The party bucked the desires of Republican 
legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis' 
leadership on the crisis. The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area. At 
least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads. 
So far, Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power 
problems, because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in 
1996, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was in office. 
""The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is: 'Fix it,' "" 
he said. "" 'We're not blaming you because we understand it didn't happen on 
your watch, but get us out of this mess.' "" 
As the state's chief executive, Davis has been criticized by industry 
executives, analysts, lawmakers and regulators for his wariness. 
In contrast, the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire 
chiefs, heads of school districts, municipal officials and the like, praised 
his ""bold, decisive leadership."" 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public 
education. 
""It's just information. It's not political at all,"" Maviglio said. ""This is 
part of a continuing effort the governor's office has done to inform the 
community about the governor's actions and policies. It was first used during 
the education proposals last year."" 
Outraged utility executives, meanwhile, said the governor's fax wrongly 
blamed them for not being more proactive. 
""I'm appalled by reading such a statement,"" said Harold Ray, executive vice 
president of Southern California Edison Co. 
Ray was particularly irked by a passage about long-term contracts between the 
state's major utilities and power providers. The governor's fax claimed that 
since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission last March 22, the PUC has approved every request from the 
utilities for authority to sign long-term contracts ""in a timely fashion."" 
Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through 
a state-run exchange could have saved his company about $1 billion. 
On Aug. 3, the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign 
such contracts, but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. executives say 
the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for 
them. 
The commission's energy division is supervised by Lynch. She told The 
Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from 
commission staff. 
Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, chair of the Rules Committee, said he 
believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent 
years. 
Cardoza, however, praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating 
plants in California, and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in 
the end because results will be what matters. 
""I don't think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we 
don't get control of this,"" said Cardoza. ""If we're able to solve the 
problem, we get kudos. If we don't, we get dinged.""

NEWS
Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis, Polls Find / Shortages join 
education as top concern
Katherine Seligman
Chronicle Staff Writer

01/18/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A11
(Copyright 2001)

Yes, the energy crisis is serious, but most Californians see it as a plot by 
power companies seeking to jack up utility bills, according to the latest 
energy poll by the Field Institute. 
The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the 
roots of the so-called crisis. More than half of those surveyed, 57 percent, 
said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates, rather than an 
emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased 
demand.
Real or fabricated, the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis 
and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids (both the Field 
Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost 
everyone is following the news). 
In fact, the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for 
Californians, according to the Public Policy Institute poll, also released 
today. That poll reveals that almost 75 percent of Californians say energy is 
""a big problem"" and only about half of those polled think economic good times 
are ahead -- a drop from 72 percent in August. 
And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation 
and the looming shortages. 
""The public is in a pretty foul mood,"" said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll. 
""They blame just about everybody. . . . The public is pretty cynical about 
how we got to this situation."" 
When asked who's to blame for the situation, about three-quarters of those in 
the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants, the 
state's private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission. 
More than 60 percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the 
state Legislature, activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an 
increase in industrial energy use. 
Gov. Gray Davis, however, came out on top of the electrical heap, with only 
43 percent blaming him for the current situation. Fifty- three percent blamed 
his predecessor, Pete Wilson. 
Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for 
utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts. When it comes 
to solving the problem, most want the state government to step in and become 
a middleman, buying electricity for the utility companies, the Field Poll 
found. 
Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good 
credit rating. The electricity would then be sold to the power companies. 
In order to fix the problem, most Californians, 61 percent, think the state 
should go back to regulating the energy industry. Only 30 percent of those in 
the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without 
re-regulation. 
In the Public Policy Institute's poll, only 37 percent advocated 
re-regulation, with 32 percent favoring the construction of more power plants 
and 20 percent leaning toward more conservation. 
Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage, most 
Californians responded in the Field Poll that they don't want air quality 
standards relaxed to produce more electricity. Only 32 percent thought that 
solution was satisfactory. 
But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to 
get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants, 
Californians were more divided. Almost half, 47 percent, approved of that 
strategy. Forty-six percent opposed it. 
The energy problems don't bode well for the state, according to those 
surveyed by the Public Policy Institute. Eighty-two percent said they thought 
the issue will damage the state's economy in the next few years, with more 
than half saying it will hurt the economy ""a great deal."" 
""Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for 
the state economy and their own pocketbooks,"" said the institute's survey 
director, Mark Baldassare. ""Right now, they are still holding out hope, but 
their optimism, as well as the political fortunes of state leaders, may 
suffer if they fail to see some action soon."" 
The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey Jan. 2-8, by 
phoning 2,011 residents. The Field Poll surveyed 1,001 Californians Jan. 
12-16.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,
Dan Piassick

I don't think we need the language, especially since the guarantees won't 
apply to retrofitting the plant later.

Subject: RE: Words to go with the other 2 emails regarding Austin

I would recommend that we not insert Eric's comments regarding the
exhaust temperature and energy guarantees for combined cycle facilities.
As Eric indicates, this is a simple cycle plant, which is similar to
Fountain Valley.  When commenting on the Fountain Valley agreement, Lee
recommended that all references to exhaust temperature and energy
guarantees be stricken and we did so.  In addition, Lee has already seen
a version of the City of Austin agreement that had Sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 (the sections Eric would like to reinstated) stricken. Let me
know what you think, but I recommend we leave them out, particularly if
such sections are not necessary and would only be useful to have in the
future if the plant ever went combined cycle.

Here's what Eric wrote:


I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those
changes
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were
related
to exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant
and
they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would
guarantee
it anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes
combined
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that
out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and
10.4.4
(and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached
to
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a
separate word file.

Exhibit F is ""boiler plate"" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit ""U"" is not in
my
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit ""T.""   If you get something
from GE on Exhibit ""U"", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Susan , Good morning. Here are my thoughts for additional items to be
included in the Transwestern Opening Brief.

1)Assurance that all intrastate capacity will be made available : Socal
shareholders are put at risk for Backbone transmission capacity revenue &
any unutilized capacity will be made available to the market. This seemed to
be of particular interest and sensitivity to the judge. Further, placing the
utility at risk for unused resources was a listed promising option.

2)Existing Socal noncore customers are given 2 unique opportunities to
select their receipt points & the core intrastate set asides guarantee that
the core is fully protected : this suggest the transition will be smooth.
Developing clear procedures for allocating capacity was an additional
promising option.

3) On the topic of implementation, can we say in TW's experience the
timeline outlined in the CAS is viable . While Socal will have to ""create""
an unbundled backbone system, the CAS allows sufficient time for Socal,
Socal customers and other interested parties to be prepared and fully
participate in the unbundled backbone system.

Call when you have a chance. Mark,IGS

Dear JASON WILLIAMS:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot
program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility
Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly
over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches
from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower,
will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for
the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.

Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This
requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader:
http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow
instructions for free download:
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_994

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th.

In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the
effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or
concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission's website at
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_47_994 or call NewPower
at 877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call 1-866-523-4176.)

Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!

Nick Utton
Chief Marketing Officer

Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from 
entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.  This could help the 
communication problem that currently exists on companies like Perry Gas.

Arnold,

I am trying to talk via MSN messenger service and it will not accept 
jarnold@enron.com or any other reasonable email path.  What is your official 
email path?  I am assuming that you are using Outlook.  I am here at work 
trying to close a deal.

I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout 
of the floor.  I will end up having spots on five and six.  Also,  Nelson 
Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the 
Wellhead/Ecommerce effort.  And yes, John will need room to grow. 

What did you think of the article?  

Mrha

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The 
area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, 
long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need 
to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf 
group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas 
trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and 
the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....
thanks for the article.

Price  1    =     WTI Cushing physical cash price  (WTI  Nymex 
contract)       For example,  the April 2001
                             WTI cushing price equals the Apr01 WTI Nymex 
contract.


 Price  2    =    Koch Oil posting for West Texas/New Mexico Intermediate.


Koch P+   =    Price 1  -  Price  2


  Price 2 is calculated by subtracting  3 spreads  from Price 1   
  
       1.    Koch Posting/Wti NYMEX basis spread  
       2.    66.6%   (April01/May01  WTI Nymex spread)
       3.    33.3%   (April01/Jun01  WTI Nymex spread)



Example   using  1/24/2001 WTI settles       APR01       28.31

April 2001  Koch posting   =     April 2001 WTI NYMEX settlement   -   
KOCH/NYMEX basis spread  -  .666(Apr/May)  -  .333(Apr/Jun)

                                                  =       28.31     -    
2.75     -    .666(.59)   -   .333(1.12)
                                                  =       28.31     -

Dear Ken,
 A lot has happened since our conversation in snowy  Washington at Joe Hilling's retirement reception.  Unable to identify a mutually agreed  upon challenge for me, I retired from Enron with the objective of providing  business leadership elsewhere.  Many  others, including Jeff Skillings, have since departed as well.  Reflecting on the events of the past  several months, I would like to talk with you regarding how my extensive  experience in managing and divesting Enron's foreign and domestic businesses and  assets could be utilized by the company on an interim basis.  My goal is to assist your efforts in  restoring investor confidence in and shareholder value of Enron, which has been  an integral part of my life for 30 years.
 I will contact your office next week to find a  convenient time for us to visit on this matter.
 Best regards,
 Mike Dahlke

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Hi!

           Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to 
confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of 
Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in place 
for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enron 
and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current 
purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.

Subject: Re: Millennium - UPDATE  

Here is the update:

1. BONY is getting a legal opinion on the ADR issuance and is in contact with 
Millenium's attorneys.

2. DKB has performed investigations on whether these ADRs must be restricted, 
DKB's view is that they should not restricted.  This is highly arcane US SEC 
law (so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points), but my 
understanding is that DKB views the sale of the local shares as a real sale, 
with a public notice, a public underwritten auction etc,and there is nothing 
restricted about the shares.  I don't think BONY would dispute that, but I 
think their interpretation (and our legal view) is that the shares are 
restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the SEC 
under the original ADR issuance and, critically, they were sold by the 
""Issuer"".   That is, BONY's view is that BNDES is the same as Millenium b/c 
they are both government entities--ie BNDES is the ""Issuer"".  Therefore, 
regardless of the public nature of sale of the shares (and the fact that the 
shares aren't restricted for trading locally in Brazil), the shares issued as 
ADRs would be restricted per US law.

Now, ultimately we have to go with what BONY says b/c they issue the ADRs.  
However, before we charge back to BONY and argue DKB's case, I would 
appreciate a review by Skadden back to me on whether these shares if issued 
as ADRs would be restricted.  We want unrestricted, NYSE ADRs if possible.

3. When the ADRs are issued, they will be issued to PEP, a Brazil company, 
but deposited in one of the CayCo parents of PEP custody account.  We will 
need to check Brazil law and revise our MS custody account accordingly to se 
eif we can do this.  Sara, again I will try to call tomorrow, I apologize for 
the delay.

4. The plan to move the ADRs out of Brazil is as follows. There will be no 
sale and no cash movement.  There may be a CPMF.  PEP will perform an 
""in-kind"" capital reduction of the shares back to its CayCo parent.  This 
will probably require some Brazil government approvals (or may not).  If so, 
what are they and how long will they take?

5. Critically, we have been advised by Brazil legal and by US tax that the 
shares if moved in this manner will move at the ORIGINAL COST BASIS.  IE, 
there is no taxbale event for US or Brazil.  Lynn, please confirm.

6. I don't have a timetable yet, I will call BONY tomorrow for an update on 
timing.

Regards,  Bruce

The PEP Cayco parent is the appropriate entity to serve as custodian for the 
ADR certificates.  PEP actually has two Cayman shareholders.  All the of the 
certificates can be issued to the 99% shareholder.  I will address via a 
separate message how the accounting entries need to be booked in order to 
reflect the fact that the 1% shareholders received shares in the capital 
reduction.

I spoke w/Theresa at BONY aand we have agreed on a fee of 1.5 cents per ADR.  
That works out to a fee of $231,654.00 on 15,443,600 expected ADRs.  Kent, 
who will handle the invoice from your group?  I emphasized that ""time is of 
the essence"".

Robert, please call me tomorrow and we can get Gareth involved to help us 
with all the issues.  Sara, I will also call you tomorrow to give you 
background.  

1. We will need to get in touch with our Brazil broker, who I assume is DKB 
(Pedro, who and at what phone number?).  

2. The broker will move our local shares to Banco Itau, the custodian bank. 

3.  BONY will issue ADR certificates to a custodian/location that we 
determine offshore (I think we would use PEP-Cayco parent, Lynn please 
confirm company).

4. I think we will use MS as custodian (assuming account contemplates holding 
physical, restricted securities--Sara, I will speak with you about this).

5. Theresa has calls in to Millenium to get ""ok"" and also is working to get 
legal opinion issued on issuing restricted ADRs pursuant to original ADR 
documentation (if I udnerstand the issue correctly).

6.  Once the shares are transferred, we will seek to do an ""in-kind"" capital 
reduction at the PEP level up to its CayCo parent and hopefully avoid any 
CPMF.  Also, we should be able to use original basis for both Brazil and US 
tax and thus no tax impact, at leats this has been indicated to us.

Yes, BONY is getting back to me today with the cost to create the ADRs.  
From  tax standpoint, Lynn has determined that if we move the shares via a 
capital reduction, there will be no Brazil or US tax (other than perhaps a 
CPMF) since we will move the shares at their original basis.  So the price 
doesn't matter too much--but I don't want to take any chances with the Brazil 
tax authorities.  Better to move the shares now when the price is pretty even 
than to move it later when the price has doubled; it would be a tempting tax 
target.

Bruce is working with Robert and Lynn trying to create ""special"" ADR that 
will not be listed.

Alternatively, specially if we are going to prepay Eletrobr?s' debt, we can 
always trade some portions of the shares, on the stock exchange between Ernon 
companies.  This method would take us some time to do all our position, but 
the advantage is we would be creating listed ADRs.

Jason, 

I am not sure whether you really require the number of tons/ mmBtu needed to fire a plant. What we really need is the cost of coal and gas in terms of $/MwH (so that you can calculate the difference between power (quoted in $/MwH) and the fuel). For that, the conversions will be as follows:

Coal
The price for coal will be quoted in $x/ Ton. To convert it to $/MwH, you will have to do the following:
Assumptions:
Heat Content		12,000 Btu/Lbs
Heat Rate		11,000 Btu/KwH
Transportation Cost	$3 /Ton

Cost ($/MwH)		((x+3)*11,000)/(2*12,000)				 

Gas
The price for coal will be quoted in $y/ mmBtu. To convert it to $/MwH, you will have to do the following:
Assumptions:
Heat Rate		10,000 Btu/KwH

Cost ($/MwH)		(y*10,000)/1,000

If possible, try to put all the assumptions as inputs in the first sheet to allow changes. Give me a call if you need any further clarification.

Trevor, I hope the above conversions are in order.

Raj,

Do you know how I can convert the following.

Number of Tons of Coal it takes to fire a plant.

Number of MMBtus of Gas it takes to fire a plant.

I need those conversions in order to do the calculations for the Sip Call.  (Unless I am looking at it wrong, and I don't need them.)

However, I still am proud to be a Beta, hope to be a better one and a better father (or is it 'farter'?), too.

Further to discussions with Tana today:

I understand there are some concerns with regard to the amount of time 
necessary to complete the due diligence process on each new company added to 
the EnronOnline customer list.

Tana has requested that we adopt some rules which would reduce the amount of 
time spent on this activity.

I am much in favour of this, but we need to ensure that the rules do not work 
such that many customers are prevented from transacting on products which 
they would otherwise be able to.

e.g. Tana has suggested that companies who are not registered in the U.S. 
should automatically receive a profile which disallows them from trading in 
U.S. physical power, as they are unlikely to hold the required FERC license 
(subject of course to review of individual requests from the companies 
themselves). I am happy with this rule, as it seems highly unlikely that 
non-U.S. companies would hold a U.S. electricity license.

If anyone would like to adopt similar rules for other products, please run 
them past me before implementation - assuming Mark and Justin are OK with the 
concept.

Thanks,

Dave

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

East Ohio
I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).  This deal should get matched with the 
purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.  The deal 
volume is 10,000 for the month.  We have the Power Gas deal thru October.  We 
still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.

I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an 
expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so 
close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.

Thanks.


Peoples
I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume 
fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This 
deal also goes through October.

We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not 
see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to 
be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for 
August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..

We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on 
this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.

Let me know if anyone has questions."

Subject: InterGen/ENA - GE Turbines & ABB Transformer

Attached are clean and redlined versions of revised drafts of (i) the
Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA
Energy Development I, LLC and the GE generator set, and (ii) the Letter
Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to the ABB
transformer.  The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP
relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will
be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper
LLC.

To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before
review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have
additional changes and comments.

In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for
Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following
requirements of InterGen:

(i)  The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been
deleted;

(ii)  A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of
Section 3; and

(iii)  A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been
added as  a new Section 17.

The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted
from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my
understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's
agreement with TRY.  ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general
language of the clause.

Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other
concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements
and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect
the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits
thereto.

I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the
closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen.

Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are
available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments
you have on the closing.

George

Don't worry with the 11GJ's just as long as we have the proper volumes over here.  Also, leap years are observed in the gas business.  When working out the number of days on excel, if you take the month in advance and subtract the current month it will give the correct number of days (including leap years).
 
Regards,
 
Jon

Jon,  Thanks for everything.  There was a small error in the buy sheet for haul - all yesterday.  I have attached a correct one.  the problem was the final buy numbers did not divide by the days in the month evenly.  the total is out 11 GJs.  Just let me know what to do.  sorry!  Also, for February on a long term contract covering a leap year, do we need to incorporate a different formula to buy for that leap month with 29 days.

Jason seemed excited about the concert.  I think  this is one of his favorite 
bands.  I enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as my eldest 
sibling.  
I am actually going to Dallas on Friday for the TX-OU game.  I am taking a

Carol:  Here's my ""short"" list of issues for Mark:

(1)  Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7:
 (a) reiterate ""rules"" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and 
advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A. works 
and   what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed 
ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.)
 (b)paralegal workload

(2)  Confirmations and need to create a ""writing""
 multiple confirms with the same counterparty 
 confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm?
 use of confirms with negative language

(3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands

(4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants

(5)  Method for shortening weather confirms

(6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments"

Pam:
I saw Janet Greene last week and she said that she was working with you.  She 
looked great!  Can we get together for lunch sometime soon?  Let me know some 
dates that work for you in the next 1-2 weeks.  I'm in the office Tuesday 
through Thursday.

Everything is going well.  Charles is on the verge of walking!  I'm now in 
the power trading group and loving the work.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Is there a suggested time for the meeting?  I'm pretty open.  I'd like to be 
sure that Jim and Paul and Mary Karen Denne can participate, too.  Do we need 
to have other commercial folks on the call (e.g., Calger, Belden, someone 
from EES (Yang and/or Benevides)?

Thanks for another tax education lesson.   I understand



Next issue -

Again this is currently confidential.  The Bentley co 1473 is transitioning to EFS with a target date of 10/1/01.  As a result, this company will no longer be a division of EESNA 15A.  It will be a legal entity of EFS.  I have been out here working on mapping of 1473 timberline accounts into SAP.  I have discovered that Timberline is not a full source G/L.  For example, no taxes are recorded, rather what is in SAP issued.  I want to get Timberline setup as a full G/L just like the other EFS groups.  I would like assistance from the tax group to make this happen.  Should the person handling 15A help us or should we wait until the transition and a new person is assigned.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Construction of Mexico's First Privately
Owned Ethylene Complex Hinges On Availability of Feedstock, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 26, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc; Houston).
Corporacion Grupo Serbo (Mexico City) first announced its intent to
construct an estimated $3 billion ethylene and derivatives complex in
Altamira, Tamaulipas earlier this year. Serbo's owner, Sergio Bolanos
Quesada, seeking partners to round out his 20% interest in the
complex, made the announcement shortly after it was revealed that
Serbo was purchasing the beleaguered engineering and construction
firm, Bufete Industrial (Mexico City). From the start, Serbo
understood that Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the state run oil and gas
monopoly, would provide 71,000 barrels per day of naphtha feedstock
for the proposed 975,000 metric ton per year ethylene cracker.
	   Pemex has been slow to sign the 25-year contract sought by Serbo
for the complex it hopes to complete by late 2005. A need to insure
feedstock supply could possibly delay the anticipated early 2002
groundbreaking of the 10-unit complex, which will include propylene,
butadiene, polypropylene and other downstream products, as well as its
own cogeneration unit for electricity and steam. Serbo also has plans
to construct a ""city"" adjoining the complex, featuring homes, schools,
churches, and hospitals, among many other features over and above
those found in more traditional ""company towns.""
	   Serbo and its partners hope to sell 95% of the complex's output on
the domestic market, with an estimated 50% going to other
petrochemical companies in Altamira. The heavily industrialized
Altamira is home to plants owned by BASF, Shell, and other chemical
majors. Serbo would have to import its naphtha feedstock if Pemex
fails to comply with their preliminary agreement, as other naphtha
sources are simply not available domestically.
	   ""With this stall, Pemex is hurting itself and quite possibly the
future of additional private petrochemical investment in Mexico,""
according to Annette Kreuger, chemical industry specialist with
Industrialinfo.com. ""With Mexico's President Vicente Fox making recent
speeches that private investment is the hope for Mexico's
petrochemical future, it doesn't bode well when a state run company is
dragging its feet over its part in a $3 billion investment -- an
investment that not only increases Mexico's protection against an
anticipated surge in foreign petrochemical imports over the next few
years but also offers an increased quality of life for an estimated
2,700 future employees.""

I like your revised version.

I have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

We should get the focus off of ""micromanaging FERC"".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the ""gerrymandering"" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a ""camel"" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the ""electricity gerrymandering"" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead."

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Thanks!

The attached reflects changes to the Sea Robin PVR factors for the June 
2000.  I have left the DBQ volumes as they were originally set and decreased 
the excess volumes.

Please let me know of any questions you have.

Thanks,

I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents,
however, to expedite matters, I am passing on some additional comments
on the letter agreements and the form of Facility Agreement to be
attached to the letter agreements.

Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter
agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter
agreement.

Facility Agreements:

1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility
Agreements should be amended to read as follows:

""If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the ""Refund Amount"")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below.""

This is the same comment I made earlier.

2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from
the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility
Agreement.

3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I
as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.

4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is
still relevant.

5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to
Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point
up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.

6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to ""oF"" should be corrected
to contain the degree symbol.

Mark,

Good Afternoon!  you have 258 shares being vested in Jan 2002. It is too
early to tell what the taxes will be, I'm sure we'll be notified before the
release date.
Thank You!

Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to 
terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They 
said they would mull it over, at least.

But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would 
get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated 
rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree 
to it.  Steve has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise."

Larry:

According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the 
ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London 
lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).  If  NY trader is also 
involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, 
etc.

The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.  I don't know how 
long this takes.

You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

As we're beginning to see the second wave of Order 637 proceeding technical 
conferences being scheduled, here is a brief update on the proposed 
timetables for the first few dockets.  As December kicks off, we are in a 
settlement mode in all the cases, with most pipelines in informal discussions 
with customers/parties to work towards consensus settlements that can be 
filed with the Commission.  

** Note that Koch, adamant that segmentation is not operationally feasible on 
its system, has circulated a settlement proposal on segmentation.  See below.


ANR, RP00-332: 

 After three technical conferences at FERC, ANR is committed to developing a 
total consensus document.  ANR is circulating their latest revisions to 
customers by December 7th, and customers are meeting without the Commission 
or the pipeline to discuss ANR's proposal on December 15th.  A follow-up 
technical conference at FERC is scheduled for January 11, 2001.


Dominion, RP00-344:

Dominion has held at least five meetings with customers to work out a 
settlement in this case.  A technical conference, originally scheduled for 
late October, has been rescheduled with FERC Staff for December 14th.  This 
should be a meeting on a settlement proposal.


Koch, RP00-340:

Koch has circulated revisions to its Order 637 filing, including a settlement 
proposal for segmentation.  There will be a conference call among Koch and 
its customers on December 5th to get comments on the tariff revisions as 
discussed at the October 25th technical conference and the new segmentation 
proposal.  After that call, a follow-up technical conference at FERC should 
be scheduled for sometime in January.

[The segmentation proposal would allow customers broader supplemental rights 
in the zones in which their primary receipt and primary delivery points are 
located.  When points are located in different zones, the customer would be 
entitled to utilize its full MDQ in each zone (in essence doubling their 
MDQ).   It's critical to Koch's offer that all segmented transactions will be 
scheduled on a supplemental basis, as this is the only protection for the 
operational integrity of its system and primary firm services of other 
customers.  The right to segmentation can be waived by customers and it will 
be available on a prospective basis only for new or renegotiated contracts.  
Koch is also proposing a ""segmentation fee"" to be assessed either to those 
customers utilizing segmentation or by all Koch customers (undecided in the 
proposal).  This fee will be used to recover all costs associated with 
developing the segmentation program and necessary computer system.]


Colorado Interstate, RP00-325:

CIG will circulate revisions by December 1st to its compliance filing as 
discussed at the pipeline's second technical conference on October 26th.  
Parties will send comments to CIG by December 10th.  The schedule, from that 
point, will go into January.  CIG may follow Dominion's lead and schedule 
settlement meetings with parties before meeting with Staff again.


Tennessee, RP00-477:

Tennessee is circulating revisions based on discussions at the November 14th 
technical conference by December 8th.  Parties will meet within two weeks of 
that date to discuss the revisions (either separately or at a FERC technical 
conference).


Kinder Morgan, RP00-343:

Kinder Morgan plans to circulate a revised 637 package by December 15th, with 
a conference call scheduled for January 4th to get feedback from customers on 
the revisions.  The pipeline believes there may not be a need for a second 
technical conference and hopes to file a settlement and implementation plan 
by the end of January.  "

Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

AFFILIATE
OHIO
Wireless companies violated separate affiliate requirements

The Public Utilities Commission has determined that Ameritech Mobile and
AirTouch Cellular violated state law by failing to maintain separate
cellular wholesale and retail operations.  The PUC's order addresses a
complaint filed in 1993 by Westside Cellular, Inc., dba Cellnet.

The PUC pointed to the testimony of Alan Ferber, general manager of
Ameritech Mobile's wholesale operations.  He acknowledged that Ameritech
Mobile's operations aren't structured as required by the PUC for sales
and marketing.  From that statement, the PUC concluded that Ameritech
Mobile wasn't separating its wholesale and retail operations ""in the
normal course of business.""

The PUC also found that Ameritech Mobile's practice of establishing
wholesale rates for nonaffiliated carriers by first consulting with its
retail employees about the potential impact on its retail business in
violation of the commission's orders in dockets 84-944 and 89-563.

Between 1995 and 1998, the commission said, Ameritech Mobile violated
the PUC's requirement for nondiscriminatory treatment of nonaffiliated
wholesale customers.  The company either didn't substantiate the more
favorable treatment afforded to its retail affiliate or didn't
substantiate that its retail affiliate paid anything at all to Ameritech
Mobile's wholesale cellular service, the commission concluded.

The commission found that AirTouch Cellular violated a prohibition on
its retail affiliate having any involvement in the operations of its
wholesale affiliate between 1991 and 1998.  During that period, AirTouch
Cellular's nonaffiliated wholesale rate was at least determined
partially by concerns related to the affiliated retail arm, the
commission said.

Based on AirTouch Cellular's own admission, the PUC found that the
company violated the provisions of the commission's orders in docket
nos. 84-944 and 89-563.  The commission found that AirTouch Cellular
failed to capture all billable minutes that should have been charged to
AirTouch Cellular's retail arm, while charging Cellnet for all of its
minutes.

The PUC found that imposing statutory penalties against the companies
isn't warranted in this case because it's a ""case of first impression.""

The commission's order is available at
http://www.puc.state.oh.us/docket/ORDERS/2001/0114/93-1758.pdf.  (Docket
no. 93-1758-RC-CSS)


SECTION 251/252
MINNESOTA
Qwest to refile controversial SGAT

Qwest Corp. asked the Public Utilities Commission to pull off the agenda
for yesterday's commission meeting its proposed statement of generally
available terms and conditions (SGAT), the PUC staff told TR.  The
company filed its original SGAT in November 2000, but the proposal
generated a lot of discussion because its prices differed from those set
by the PUC.  Staff said it expects Qwest to refile the SGAT ""relatively
soon.""  (Docket no. P-421/M-00-1590)


WIRELESS
ARIZONA
Ban on drivers' use of handheld cellphones dies in committee

A bill that would have banned the use of handheld wireless phones,
personal computers, or any other electronic device while driving died in
the Senate Commerce Committee, the legislative staff has told TR.
(1/9/01 a.m.)  The staff said SB 1005, which was sponsored by Sen. Tom
Smith (R., District 26), received ""tremendous"" opposition from the
wireless phone industry.

Last year Smith introduced a similar bill that also died in the Senate.
That bill, unlike SB 1005, didn't include an exception for hands-free
devices.  (1/24/00 p.m.)

Violators who weren't involved in a car accident would have been subject
to a $50 civil penalty.  Violators involved in an accident would have
been subject to a $100 civil penalty.  The officer at the scene of an
accident would have had to report on the accident form whether an
electronic device was in use at the time of the accident.

The bill would have required wireless phone packaging to include the
warning: ""The use of a cellular telephone while operating a motor
vehicle has been known to be a cause of traffic accidents, and the use
of a handheld cellular telephone while operating a motor vehicle is
prohibited by law in the state of Arizona.""


FUTURE OF REGULATION
MISSISSIPPI
Sen. Carlton aims to pass UETA

Sen. Neely C. Carlton (D., District 22) has introduced SB 2678 to enact
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).  The bill aims to
facilitate e-commerce by giving electronic records and signatures the
same legal effect as their pen and paper counterparts.

In addition to enacting UETA, SB 2678 would repeal the sections of
Mississippi Code that make up the Digital Signature Act of 1997.

SB 2678 has been referred to the Senate Committee on Fees, Salaries, and
Administration.


MERGERS
MONTANA
PSC would gain authority over utility mergers under bill

A bill to grant the Public Service Commission authority over utility
mergers has been referred to the Senate Energy and Telecommunications
Committee.  Under SB 276, the commission would have the authority to
allocate some or all of the gain or profit of an acquisition to the
utility's ratepayers.

The bill would prohibit the commission from approving an acquisition or
transfer of a public utility unless, after notice and hearing, it finds
the (1) acquisition to be in the public interest, (2) the acquisition
won't diminish the utility's ability to provide adequate and reliable
service, (3) the costs of and rates for supply service wouldn't be
increased, and (4) the applicant has the financial ability to operate
and maintain the utility.

This bill would affect Montana Power Co. plan to sell its electric
distribution assets, the PSC staff explained to TR.  Currently the
commission only has implied authority over utility acquisitions or
transfers.  This bill would clarify that authority.

Sen. Ken Toole (D., District 27) is the measure's sponsor.


CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
OREGON
Lawmakers take aim at 'slamming'

A bill introduced in the House would prohibit ""slamming,"" or the
unauthorized switch of a customer's telecom service provider.  HB 2214
would make it illegal to combine an offer to provide local or long
distance telecom service with an offer to participate in a sweepstakes
or promotion involving a prize.

The bill, which was requested by Attorney General Hardy Myers (D.),
would prohibit using any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud with the
intent to change a subscriber's telecom provider.

HB 2214 would authorize the AG to impose a maximum civil penalty of
$25,000 for each violation of the Act.  The bill also would allow any
person who suffered a loss of money or property as a result of slamming
to recover actual damages or $200, whichever is greater.

HB 2214 awaits consideration in the House Smart Growth and Commerce
Committee.


CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
NEW JERSEY
Bill would establish no-call list

Assemblyman Kevin J. O'Toole (R., District 21) has introduced AB 3065 to
require telemarketers to identify themselves and their businesses or
organizations before asking for a telephone subscriber by name or
soliciting business from a telephone subscriber.

Violators of the proposed law would be subject to a civil penalty of up
to $1,000 for a first violation and up to $2,500 for each subsequent
violation.  The bill has been referred to the Telecommunications and
Utilities Committee.

The committee also is considering another telemarketing bill.  AB 3028,
sponsored by Assemblywoman Linda R. Greenstein (D., District 14), would
prohibit unsolicited telemarketing calls to telephone customers who
placed their names on a no-call list.  (12/13/00 a.m.)

AB 3065's text is available at
http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2000/Bills/a3500/3065_i1.htm.


WIRELESS
MINNESOTA
Legislation would restrict driving while using a mobile phone

The House Crime Prevention Committee is considering a bill to make it a
misdemeanor to use a mobile telephone while driving.  Rep. Mike Jaros
(D., District 7B) introduced HF 200 yesterday.


INTERNET
MISSOURI
Bill would limit minors' Internet access

Sen. Bill Kenney (R., District 8) has introduced a measure to prevent
minors from accessing pornographic content over the Internet on public
access computers.

SB 42 would require public schools that offer Internet access either to
install filtering software or to use an Internet service provider that
filters content.  Public libraries either could purchase filtering
software or create a policy to define ""community standards"" of material
that is ""pornographic for minors"" and restrict access to such content.

School and library employees who failed to comply with SB 42 could be
charged with a misdemeanor, while employees who complied with the law
wouldn't be held liable for minors' obtaining pornographic material on a
public access computer.

The Senate Education Committee held a hearing Jan. 17 on the
legislation.  Although it hasn't passed out of the committee yet, it's
expected to do so, a legislative staff member told TR.

During the hearing, the Missouri Library Association agreed to support
SB 42 if an amendment were added to state specifically that ""public
library personnel"" who comply with the bill couldn't be held liable for
minors' accessing pornographic content on public access computers.  The
amendment met with no opposition, the staff member said.


INTERCOMPANY COMPENSATION
VIRGINIA
SCC requests comment on $20.5 million Sprint access rate settlement

The State Corporation Commission has requested comments by Feb. 1 on an
access rate settlement between the SCC staff and Sprint Corp.'s
incumbent local exchange companies--United Telephone-Southeast, Inc.,
and Central Telephone Co. of Virginia.

The settlement would result in a $20.5 million cumulative reduction in
the Sprint companies' intrastate switched access rates over three
years.  (1/9/01 a.m.)  AT&T Corp. has promised to pass the savings
through to its long distance customers.

The SCC said it will hold a hearing March 20 if one is requested.

In December 2000 the commission approved similar access rate settlements
with Verizon Virginia, Inc. (formerly Bell Atlantic-Virginia, Inc.) and
Verizon South, Inc. (formerly GTE South, Inc.).  The two Sprint
companies are the only incumbent carriers remaining in the commission's
original investigation.  (Case no. PUC000003, Investigation of the
appropriate level of intrastate access service prices)

GEORGIA
New Edge brings broadband services to Augusta

New Edge Networks, Inc., has finished installing the infrastructure
necessary to offer broadband services, including digital subscriber line
(DSL), in Augusta.  The DSL service is available to about 75% percent of
Augusta households and companies.  Other broadband offerings available
from New Edge include frame relay, wide area networks, and virtual
private lines.

Subject:	directions for June 21-22

If you have not yet registered for the June 21-22 conference, please do so
to help our planning and to obtain contact information for you.

I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual.

If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at your
hotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one at
the meeting room.  Detailed directions can be found on the website but here
is a summary from Highway 101 North & South:

      Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino
      Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.
Stay
      in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus.  At the
four-way
     stop, turn right onto Campus Drive.  Take first left (Lasuen Street)
and drive
     to the end and park.  Conference site is at this building.  If you do
not yet have
     a parking permit, we will give you one there.

I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.
Hill

Subject: FERC reports on Plant Closures in Callifornia and Northwest Prices 
in Nov & Dec

Good News.  FERC issued three reports yesterday:  a Response of the Staff of 
the FERC to Questions Posed at December 20, 2000 Western Governors 
Association Denver Meeting; a Staff Report to the FERC on Northwest Power 
Markets in Nov. and Dec. 2000; and a Report on Plant Outages in the State of 
California.  All three reports can be downloaded from FERC's page on bulk 
power markets, found at http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm. 

From a quick scan of the pricing and outage reports, the results are very 
favorable.  FERC found no evidence that plants were down for other than 
maintenance or emissions problems.  The pricing report found that prices in 
the NW during the two months tracked the increased demand and supply 
shortfall.

Arnold,  Do you have a name and number of the Plains attorneys (or someone 
who has their number) so I can discuss the attached issues with them 
concering the Comm Agreement.

I think you should talk to their attorney directly.  Relevant points are:

1.  This is actually a 12 MW substation.  

3.  The communications are for their use only and don't really effect us 
except they might want to interrupt us when it is down.  That would of course 
be unacceptable.

Subject: Re: Revised Comm Agreement  

Three problems with this Draft.

1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to 
meet ""all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver"".  My 
concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our 
load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement 
for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.

2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any 
in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would 
be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely 
and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our 
in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in

3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication 
Equipment.  This was not in the first draft.  We need some assurance that 
this equipment will do the job we need it to.

I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their

Stinson,
?
Here are some options considering what you  have
said:
?
1)? We can do a full week of class from May 7 to  11.
?
2)? The second option is to split the  course over two weeks.
If you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of  training 
then we can try this.? We have done  this before and it has 
worked fairly well.? It would be like:
?
Week 1 (20 hours):? Feb 20-23, Tue-Fri,  12:00 to 5:00
Week 2 (20 hours):?  April 9-12, Mon-Thu, 12:00 to 5:00
?
These are the only two weeks that are available for Venkat  
to teach before May 7th date.? 
?
Please let me know if these would work.? I  look forward to 
hearing from you.?
?
Regards,
?
- Siva

Stinson,

I have attached a file  along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
Java  class.

We would like to do the class from Monday thru
Friday, 8 AM  to 5 PM.? That way we can complete
the class within a?  week.? We are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few  hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
other clients  and because of that? we won't
be available.

Currently, we can  do the class from Feb. 19th
through Feb. 23 (that is if you are working  on
Feb 19th, President's day).

I will call? you sometime this  afternoon to talk
further.? Please feel free to reach me if you  have
any further questions in the mean time.

Regards,

-  Siva

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

Subject:	CPUC protest to TW RP97-288

Attached is the CPUC's Protest, Notice of Intervention and Request for Tech. Conference and/or hearing filed yesterday in RP97-288-017.

The CPUC is protesting the revised tariff sheets filed Oct. 31.

In a nutshell, the CPUC argues ""the fundamental issue that should be investigated  is whether the maximum recourse rate is in fact functioning as the FERC intended to assure fair and reasonable use of negotiated rates by a pipeline with market power.""

Hi all,

I am on the move again.  In case anyone has travel plans to the NE or TX,
I'll will be in either NJ or DC from the 4th-24th of March and in Corpus
Christi from the 24th of March through early May.  I'll settle in at Pax
River (SE MD) sometime in late May.  This email account should remain active
throughout or you can reach me at conway77@hotmail.com or on my cell at
850.939.8989.

Hope all is well,

Frank "

If the plants become an external counterparty, the fee should probably go 
back to the 
scale in the original contract.  The assumption being that the original plant 
financing could afford
the escalating fee.

Let me know if you want me to look into it any further.

thanks

Darren,

How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about 
yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee 
was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of the 
project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk 
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

To EWS Legal Department:

Please review the email below from Bonnie White of the Litigation Unit concerning a third-party subpoena served today on Enron Corp. by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  If you have had any dealings with either of these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of the entities, please contact me or Bonnie White by noon Thursday, October 4.  Thank you for your assistance.

Linda,

As we discussed, Enron Corp. was served with a subpoena by the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce documents related to Texon Energy Corporation, of Las Vegas, Nevada, and Lonestar Petroleum Corporation, also of Las Vegas, Nevada  (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have been requested to produce all documents that Enron has related to these entities.  The specific requests are:

1.	All documents concerning Texon including but not limited to agreements or contracts between Enron and Texon, purchase orders, invoices, and correspondence concerning any technical, professional, or other services.

2.	All documents concerning Lonestar including but not limited to agreements or contracts between Enron and Lonestar, purchase orders, invoices, and correspondence concerning any technical, professional, or other services.

The subpoena has a return date of October 5, 2001.  While it is likely that we can get an extension of this return date, I would like to find out whether we think we have any responsive documents before that deadline.  I appreciate your help in sending this information and request out to EWS legal.  Please have responses sent to either me or you by e-mail, by noon on October 4, 2001.  I also understand that you will have someone begin a search of EWS databases for references to these two entities.

Thanks.

I assured him you folks knew what volume we buy/sell @ GD as soon as you get

We finally had a conversation with Bill Garner at Petrie Parkman late
Wednesday afternoon, 2/21/01.  Tom Brown representatives are not discussing
the status of the WEP acquisition with any entities.

Bill informed us that they are in negotiations with a single entity for the
entire Wildhorse Package as included in the data room plus some additional
Colorado assets that were not included in the package.  Bill also informed
us (and the reason he returned our call) is that he indicated he believes
the entity would be ""friendly"" to Crescendo  and has expressed interest (to
them) in ""working with us"" on our project and plans.  We reminded him that
there are still issues with our existing contract that need to be
expediently resolved, and we aren't going to wait 6 months to resolve these
issues.  He assured us that Tom Brown is very aware of contractual issues.
He indicated that the entity wanted to contact Crescendo now (before
execution of the PSA), but TBI insists on working through PSA issues before
contact with Crescendo.  A PSA review meeting is scheduled for next week.
Bill said he would make introductions for us as soon as the PSA is executed.

Bill also informed us that it was TBI management that made the decision to
sell all the assets instead of breaking up, even if breaking up brought a
higher sale price.

I spoke with my friend at IBM's San Jose office.  He is an IBM Fellow in the
Advanced File Architecture department of the Almaden Research Center.  His
name is Dr. Steven R. Hetzler.  Email is hetzler@almaden.ibm.com.  Phone is
408-927-2614.  I mentioned your son's areas of expertise, and he was
interested in receiving a copy of his resume if your son might be
interested. As I mentioned, Steve's area of interest is storage technology.
Feel free to contact him and mention my name.  He said that IBM put on a
hiring freeze three weeks ago, so it may be a couple of months until he can
hire.  But, he has openings for the right people when he gets authority.

Subject: Curve Validation

Outlined below are some details of the existing curve validation process and 
its application to the proposed validation of tariff curves.

Wholesale Curve Validation

The existing process incorporates validation of all wholesale curves and 
includes monthly validations and random curve reviews. Every month, results 
of the validation are summarized in a memo and distributed to the Senior 
Management. Results of the random curve reviews are brought up to the 
attention of Desk Heads responsible for the respective curves and Senior 
Management as necessary.

Curve Assessment
 Green: 
  - curve is reasonable
  - small P&L impact from curve shift
 Yellow:
  - curve is illiquid
  - medium-to-large position and P&L impact from curve shift
  - some ability to validate prices from external sources
 Red:
   - curve mark is inaccurate (based on external data obtained)
  -  curve is illiquid: no ability to validate externally
  - significant positions and P&L impact from curve shift

Curves that are inaccurately marked based on data obtained from external 
sources are urged by the Senior Management to be corrected. In the cases 
where external data is not available or clear, the Senior Management urges 
the respective Desk Head not to increase an already large illiquid position 
or to built in a risk premium by widening the respective bid/offer spread and 
not to take on positions inside of that spread.

Selection Criteria
The criteria for monthly curve selection are the following:
 P&L sensitivity
 Largest positions
 Staleness (curves have not been marked for a period of time)
 Completeness (curves that have not been validated in a long time)

The main criteria for random curve validation is new deals.

Curve Validation Tools
Broker Quotes/Other external data
Graph Analysis (curve slope vs. a peer group, curve humps/sculpting vs. a 
peer group, curve shift vs. position shift, etc.)
New Deal Analysis (comparison of curve marks and executed/quoted prices)
Boundary Analysis/V@R Simulations (comparison of curve to simulated curve 
boundaries using Enron's V@R Engine)
SAVA Model Comparison (comparison of curves to model generated results)


Tariff Curve Validation

Scope/Timing:
ASAP - 20 curves with the largest positions related to deals pending review: 
(Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, Starwood) - to ensure timely and smooth approval of 
these deals.
Next 30-days - 20 curves with the largest positions/P&L impact
Monthly/Quarterly - 20 curves selected based on criteria described above
Randomly - curves with significant positions/P&L impact, resulting from new 
deals

Data Gathering:

This Month:  Listing of 20 curves (related to deals in progress) and the 
related support requested by EGA (to be provided by Scott Stoness)
On-going Basis:  The process of obtaining data should be streamlined and the 
curve validation process should be relatively painless:
    - RAC should have access to the curve data (Minal Dalia is fully devoted 
to EES and is currently residing on the EES floor)
    - Curve assumptions should be documented (to be provided by Scott Stoness)

Execution/Reporting:

RAC, EGA and EES Risk Management Group work together on curve validation 
utilizing available tools and work on developing new tools 
Utilize the Wholesale Curve Assessment methodology (Green, Yellow, Red) 
Generate a curve validation report (see template attached)
Provide feedback to the Desk Heads and distribute the Curve Validation Report 
to Enron and EES Senior Management 



Other Curves

Other curves related to EES business should be gradually incorporated into 
the aforesaid process (ancillary services, congestion, DSM and labor related 
curves) - let us set a timetable.

In conclusion, curve validation results should be evaluated in conjunction 
with other risk analytics: stress testing of prices, volatilities and 
correlations, Value-at-Risk/Capital-at-Risk analysis, performance measures, 
capital allocation framework, etc.

Vlady.

Subject: Counterparty and Product Type Matrix

Debbie/Tom,

Attached is a new version of the counterparty and product type matrix.  The 
counterparties are broken into three sections.  The first section contains 
counterparties that were included in credits original approved list with 
limits noted.  The second section contains counterparties that were included 
in credits second approved list without any limits noted.  The third and last 
section contains counterparties that will be included in the initial 
mailshot, but have not yet been reviewed by credit.  Please note that there 
are also new product types in row 7 that were not on any of the matrices you 
have previously reviewed.  These new product types are highlighted in yellow 
and inserted next to similar product types.

Please call me with any questions/comments.

Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I got an invoice for the gas we bought from Apache for Tenaska IV and they 
have a different price.  For deal 384247, we have a price of 2.285 and a 
demand fee of 0.457 for 25,000/day.  Apache is billing us at 2.175 with no 
demand charge.  Can you verify this price for me and let me know which is 
correct?

Thanks,

This is Chris Love with ETS Technology Infrastructure.  I was asked to check 
the link mentioned below because Gayle said that it was not working on her 
computer but that you replied to her telling her that it was functioning.  
The link is on http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf ... I have tried this 
link in 3 different browsers on 4 different computers and it is not working.  
Maybe the link is there but it's got high traffic, but we've tried it several 
times over the last hour and it is not responding, the message that we're 
getting is that ""A connection could not be established with the server.""  
Please respond.

Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks 
left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join 
the fun.

FYI.  Looks like what we suspected is about to launch, i.e., an orchestrated 
effort by Davis to go after the suppliers.  Just found out the following from 
Sue Mara, who attended the ISO board meeting today:

The ISO is scheduled to release a ""report"" today claiming that suppliers are 
price gouging.
The California AG has subpoena-ed generator-members of the WPTF---very 
extensive questions asking for just about everything under the sun.

Likely that we can expect a loud call for regional price caps very soon.

Best,
Jeff

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)
2/28/1 18:56 (New York)

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)

     (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)

     New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.

                        No Names Mentioned

    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.

                     Buying the Grid

     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

Brian,

Could you provide me the userids that have access to these apps.  We do not recognize them and need to find out if anybody is still running them.

Thanks, d.n.

 Attached please find a clean copy of the Salmon Energy Turbine
Agreement (the second document below), which includes Lee Johnson's
proposed changes to Section 10.7, as well as a blackline (first document
below) showing changes to the (3/27) version you forwarded earlier
today. I have include notes within the agreement indicationg those
places where questions remain - e.g., how the addition of the new
turbine affects the pricing schedule, guaranteed delivery, etc.

Hey Paul,
I know you're busy, but can you let me know where to find the map detailing the Northeast transfers limits you included in the presentation you put together for Dana.
I'd like to include it in a presentation I'm putting together for John Llodra.
Thanks,
Max"

Dear Friends,
Just a brief word,
Please read Matthew 27:39-44. This is part  of a Lenten  study that I will be doing between now and Easter.  J. Ellsworth Kalas has  written many books the reflect today's theological thinking. The book for Lent  is Seven Words to the Cross. The first word is ""Scorn."" We will look at this  first word and then in March we will look at another one of the seven. I really  hope all of you can be here.

 When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on 
another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 
(1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream 
pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas 
transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one 
of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, 
the Commission stated:  

The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has 
acquired on an upstream 
pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the 
gas on the upstream 
pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will 
not, however, allow the pipeline 
to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will 
be the shipper on the upstream 
pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results 
in a limited exception to the rule 
that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. 

I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this 
filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel 
free to pass this along to your contact at PNM."

but to work it out with Eric and i gave him yours and Cindy's name rather

Vince:  Your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of
the Lays is welcomed.  I hope that this would mean that you would remain
involved at some level.  The design of the model and its potential
economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be.   Enron could
be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
commercialization could be successfully accomplished.  Please
confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the
interest generated.  I am ready to meet there at your building or
elsewhere that is appropriate.  Best regards,  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

Yes. Let's do 1:30 for an internal call.  I'll get Suzanne to send out the 
dial-in instructions.  Let's make sure that the GE guys know NOT to call in.  
Thanks!.  I know that John Schwartzenburg will be late since he is

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

I have the final audit report from AA.  It was delivered with the 
reconciliation that we requested AA to perform.

If you remember, AA finished their study about the time of the final 
negotiations with AEP.  After discussions with Brian
the audit was findings were put on hold.

I agree with Ed about AA being caught in the middle.  They were really 
functioning as our internal audit staff, plus
trying to stay neutral about their findings.  If Enron is going to audit the 
last year of service ending April, I would like to
go ahead and notify Reliant/Entex and find another firm to perform the audit. 

Let me know the next steps if any.

Thanks

bob

Subject: Re: ENTEX

A summary of AA's final audit results was never delivered to me, Brenda and 
Bob (I have added Brenda and Bob to the distribution) were handling the AA 
audit team and I have never seen a compilation of the items we agreed to in 
our last meeting with AA just before the HPL sale negotiations started.  This 
does not mean Bob or Brenda may not have the information but I have never 
seen it.  (Confidentially, I think AA was struggling with their role in this 
because Entex/Reliant is such a large customer of theirs)  In our last 
meeting we agreed to use the audit issues as leverage to clarify the intent 
of the contract.  Who were the other suppliers, how were they allocated, 
clear definition of which citygates HPL served off-system and access to 
balancing information on a real time basis for planning purposes.  A better 
understanding of Entex's transportation agreement on Midcon and a more 
proactive role in the management of the transportation contract  Or, if we 
could not get some of this information and cooperation, HPL would reduce its 
role with Entex to deliveries at HPL's sales point (basically out of HPL's 
asset) into Midcon, etc.

Clarification of contract issues will help HPL identify those Entex markets 
we can consider incremental on other pipelines (currently Entex/Midcon claims 
some Midcon citygates are outside the 10 bcf commitment and additive to 
Midcon's supply contract with Entex (part of HPL's audit issues is that there 
is no definitive agreement on which ones).  Indentification has the affect of 
determining those Entex markets HPL should spend their capital on because 
theoretically we have the other markets via the transportation agreement.

Other issues revolve around Entex's allocation proceedure for R/C and 
industrial gas users.  As you all know, there is a significant difference in 
price between the two.  Entex's allocation proceedure needs to be clearly 
documented and supported.  HPL is in the unusual position of having its 
customer (Entex) determine the allocation and whether or not the customer 
(Entex) has met all its obligations, naturally, the customer rarely falls 
short of its contractual requirements with this process.

Any monies recovered in this process belong to the desk, it was their 
performance risk, storage revenue, P/L etc that was at risk during the 
contract year.  Additionally, a new audit period for the last contract year 
will be at the end of this month.  If Enron is going to pursue this, it would 
be appropriate to contact Entex for preperation for an additional audit.  I 
suggest we avoid the AA conflict (we should have enough work papers etc. to 
support the effort) and go with one of the other large audit firms who has no 
alliance to Reliant or Entex.

Team:

I met with Brad Blevins and Jim Ducote today regarding credits and 
obligations (implied, documented or otherwise) between Entex, ENA and HPL.  
We need to pull the above group together to get a consistent view on:

1. The definition and transfer of ENA obligations to Entex and reserves 
against those obligations to HPL/AEP.

2. The creation of an A/R invoice to Entex for payment based on the 
definitive results of the audit.

Brad/Jim:  can you email the note you gave me today to the above group.

Tom/Ed:  can you pull together a summary of the results of the audit showing 
what Entex owes HPL and what Entex owes ENA.

Lillian: can you arrange a meeting with the above group to discuss.

Thanks,
Brian

Two files are attached. The first file is the text and figures of a plan for 
characterizing impacted soil in the former surface impoundment areas. The 
second file contains the attachments to the characterization plan. The 
attachments include copies of soil boring logs and a summary of some previous 
soil sample results. I will also send a hard copy of the plan to you via 
FedEx. Transwestern is ready to proceed upon approval from the NMOCD and the 
NMED HRMB. Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

Info on Aruba:

Go to www.funjet.com
click on Carribean, then aruba.  It will list all of the hotels.  We are staying at the Allegro Resort Aruba - All Inclusive.  If you click on it, you  can find out about the hotel.
To price, click on reservations at the top, answer all of the questions.  Departure date is 10/17/01, flying on American,  and we are staying 4 nights.  Click 'check availability'.  Then you will have to pick your flights and hotel.  We got the insurance so we can cancel at the last minute - in the case of weather or whatever!  It will price it up for you but you can't book online.

I went through Dee (x1176) at Travel agency in the park.  They seem to get a better price than you are quoted online.

Gerald, don't be scared!  I should have eaten dinner last night!  Elizabeth had fun and that guy got her number!  Another high five to me for playing cupid!! Ha!

Not quite as easy as January, but here it is:

2/2 & 3:  Deal #510940.1 - shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/2 & 2/3  PGE Purch total :  $699,706.40

2/5 & 6:  EPMI missing 400mw both sales & purch side, @ $0.10 adder - check presched sheets.
2/5 Totals:  PGE Sales - $650,589.20    PGE Purch - $646,262.00
2/6 Totals:  PGE Sales - $854,589.52    PGE Purch - $848,622.32

2/7 & 2/8 :  Deal #515017.1 (2/7) & deal#516006.1 (2/8) show adder of $4.25.  The adder should be $4.50.
2/7 PGE Sales total:  $877,642.40

2/8 ALSO:  Deal #516034.1 shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/8 PGE Sales total:  $1,644,733.04

2/23 & 24:  Deal #529170.1 & #529171.1 shows wrong index - should NOT be OFF.
2/23  PGE Sales total:  $869,711.36    PGE Purch total:  $863,688.16
2/24  PGE Sales total:  $869,132.96    PGE Purch total:  $863,109.76

February 2001 PGE Sales totals:  $30,577,660.00
February 2001 PGE Purch totals:  $30,426,003.84


There is a sheet showing PA for 2/1, 2/2 & 2/3, 1200mw @ $4.00.  I already show the $4.00 adder for 600mw for each of those days.  So, I'm clueless why these have been done.

Hello Mark, David, Matt, Jane and Angeline,

I have provided the additional questionnaire which we sent to our European 
counsel with respect to trading in Bandwidth capacity. You may wish to 
provide this to your counsel as a basis for the questionnaire regarding the 
physical trading of Bandwidth capacity. Please note that one of the key 
issues may be the location of the respective geographical points for each 
Bandwidth transaction. We would anticipate that there would be fewer issues 
or none at all where a particular counterparty wishes to trade in Bandwidth 
capacity where the two respective geographical points are not located in 
their jurisdiction. (ie. A German counterparty trading Bandwidth from 
Brussels to Paris)


If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me at 
0207 783 4084.

Kind Regards,

Ian Brungs

Sameh - Thought I would touch base to see how the responses turned out.  Do you think you have a ""workable"" vehicle or  were there too many moving parts?

Call me at 713-853-1688 if you want to dicuss it.

Stephanie:

We have released our RFP for the pipeline capacity and Wallula tolling.  I
will be sending you an original copy via FEDEX, but wanted you to have the
enclosed copy for expediency.  I have also attached the heat balance diagram
(which is Attachment 3 to the Reverse RFP) so that your technical people can
have a basis to start from.  Attachments 1 and 2 you already have through
the PGT open season process, but we will include the version that we
executed in the FEDEX package.  Let me know if you have any questions.

We should get the focus off of ""micromanaging FERC"".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the ""gerrymandering"" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a ""camel"" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the ""electricity gerrymandering"" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead."

Zeno's paradox (ZEE-no PAR-uh-doks) noun

   Any of various versions of a paradox regarding the relation of the
   discrete to the continuous and requiring the concept of limit for its
   satisfactory explanation.

[After Zeno of Elea, circa 490-430 B.C.]

   ""Oh, if you're looking
   for a timetable, it's there, in that train, that's now
   two feet away, now one, but will never obstruct
   or demolish us. Thank heaven for Zeno's paradox!""
   John Ashbery, Love in boots, The American Poetry Review, Jan 2, 1995.

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.

.............................................................................
Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no
learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. -Ralph
Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to 
sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for 
everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it 
before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no 
problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have 
to get in the habit of doing it.

Thanks again,
Kate

 Hello Kate, thank your so much for everything.  Me and Jennifer both
like email better than fax.  Therefore, you can start emailing to us from
now on.  About counter-party, we prefer to be on the report but if it takes
too much of your time then it is up to you to include it or not.  We need
conter-party's name when we confirm any kind of mismatch problem.  If you
include on the report, it save you from us calling you.  Otherwise, we have
to call you and ask for counter-party's name when we need to confirm any
transactions.  It is your call.
 Again, thank you and feel free to call me if you have any further
questions/concerns.
 Eric

P.S.  By the way, do you have any regular Firm On and Off Peak for Sunday?

The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery
points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you
have any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should
look identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a
detail of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the
counterparty names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at
this sheet normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of
faxing the prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.

As an FYI, our DC office heard today that FERC may issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) potentially strengthening affiliate codes of conduct in the natural gas industry on June 25.  The range of outcomes could go from anywhere from simply rationalizing 497 (natural gas code of conduct) and 889 (electric code of conduct) through full divestiture (although this is highly unlikely).

If this happens, it is most directly the result of the on-going litigation at FERC surrounding El Paso Merchant's use of capacity into California.

As soon as we hear anything additional, we'll let you know.

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

Here's a really interesting service summarizing ISO activities.  Also read 
the content about governance and confidential information.  If the PX conveys 
its confidential information to the ISO, it would violate the PX's tariff 
(but what's new?).  On governance, the new directors are hoping that people 
will be results-oriented in deciding whether to challenge them at FERC.

Free KNOW THE ISO service

You recently inquired about subscribing to Phoenix Consulting's California
ISO analysis/reporting service, KNOW THE ISO.  I am writing to let you know
about a special offer available until March 1st only.
.
With any new subscription between now and the end of the month, you can
receive free service for the month of February (including any reports we've
issued so far this month).  Service this month includes Event Reports
covering these important topics:
.
>Stakeholder meetings about:
  -- The ISO's draft generator Market Power Monitoring/Mitigation Proposal
(plus our special report summarizing the ISO's proposal, and the others
offered at the January 23rd FERC technical conference);
.
  -- Proposed changes to the pricing/dispatch order for Imbalance Energy
supplies, and other near-term ISO tariff change proposals;
.
  -- Proposed generator availability standards, and the penalties proposed
for violating them;  and
.
  -- The 2000 ISO Control Area Transmission Expansion Plan.
.
>Meetings of the new state-appointed ISO Board, where the new members will
decide:
  -- Summer 2001 demand-side program bidding results/contract awards;
.
  -- Summer 2001 peaking generation contract results and unit construction
progress;
.
  -- Eligibility of PG&E interruptible end-use customers for ISO demand-side
programs;  and
.
  -- ISO policies regarding Distributed Generation.
.
You'll also be on board to receive our reports for March, when the ISO will
address Congestion Management Reform, dual-fuel requirements for generators,
the New Facilities Connection Policy (for generator/load interconnection
with the grid), and the Long-Term Grid Planning Policy.

KNOW THE ISO subscribers include municipal and investor-owned utilities,
regulatory bodies, ISO Board members, generator owners and developers, law
firms, consulting firms, trade-industry associations, power marketers,
Scheduling Coordinators, retail Energy Service Providers, and consumer
groups.  They receive accurate information about important ISO events within
about 2 days, including our unique insider perspective and explanations, for
less each month than the cost of a single overnight trip to Folsom or an
hour of high-level consulting service.

If you've been meaning to subscribe but just haven't gotten around to
filling out the form, don't worry - just reply to this e-mail message
confirming your decision to subscribe, then follow up with the paperwork
later.  (For your convenience, we've attached another KNOW THE ISO Services
Description Package, with cost information and a subscription form, along
with another couple of free samples.)

We'll add you immediately to our mailing list and send you any reports from
earlier this month (including the special reports on generator market power
monitoring/mitigation).

I look forward to hearing from you.  Please call me at one of the numbers
shown below for answers to any questions you may have.

Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
next to ours.  
Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I ""manually"" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a
